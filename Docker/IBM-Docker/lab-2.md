# Lab 2: Add CI/CD value with Docker images

## Docker Image
Summary
The lab focuses on creating custom Docker images using Dockerfiles. A Docker image is essentially a compressed file system archive used to create containers, enabling easy sharing and distribution across environments. Docker Hub serves as the default public registry for pulling and pushing images, but private registries are also important for enterprise use. Dockerfiles contain instructions to build images, with each line forming a separate cached layer. This layering system optimizes build and push processes by reusing unchanged layers, significantly speeding up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Docker images use a union filesystem with a copy-on-write mechanism to maintain read-only layers while allowing containers to have writable layers on top, saving disk space and improving efficiency. The lab includes hands-on exercises to build, run, and push custom images, demonstrating the benefits of layer caching through incremental updates.

Key Insights
üê≥ Docker Image Architecture: Docker images are structured as layered tar archives, which represent the file system for containers. This abstraction allows for easy sharing and consistent execution environments across different hosts and environments. Understanding this helps in effective image management and troubleshooting.
üóÑÔ∏è Layered Caching Mechanism: Each Dockerfile instruction creates a new immutable layer, which Docker caches. When building or pushing images, Docker reuses these cached layers if unchanged, drastically reducing build times and network usage‚Äîcritical for efficient CI/CD workflows.
üîê Private vs Public Registries: While Docker Hub is great for publicly available images and learning, private registries are essential for enterprise security and control. Enterprises can self-host registries using Docker images, offering flexibility and integration with internal infrastructure.
üìÇ Union Filesystem & Copy-On-Write: Docker‚Äôs union filesystem merges multiple read-only image layers into a single unified view in containers. Copy-on-write ensures that container-specific changes do not alter the base image, enabling safe reuse and sharing of image layers among multiple containers.
üí° Optimizing Dockerfile for Caching: Ordering Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changing improves build efficiency. For example, placing source code additions at the end allows earlier layers to be cached and reused, minimizing rebuild times when code changes.
üíæ Storage Efficiency: Because image layers are shared and read-only, running thousands of containers from the same image consumes minimal additional disk space‚Äîonly a small writable layer per container‚Äîmaximizing host resource utilization.
üöÄ Practical Lab Application: The hands-on lab reinforces theoretical concepts by guiding users through creating a Dockerfile, building and running images, pushing to Docker Hub, and observing caching effects during updates, providing practical understanding of Docker image layering and optimization.

Notes:

Docker Image
- TAR file containing a container's filesystem + metadata
- For sharing and redistribution

Docker Registry
- push and pull image from registry
- default registry: Docker Hub
    - Public and free for public image
    - many pre-packaged images available
- Private registry
    - self-host or cloud provider options

Create a Docker image - with docker build
- Create a "Dockerfile"
    - list of instructions for how to construct the container
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile
```
```bash
$ cat Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
ADD myapp /
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT /myapp
```

Secret sauce: Docker image layer

Docker image layer
- Union file system
    - merge image layer into single file system for each container
- copy-on-write
    - copies file that are edited up to top writable layer 
- Advantages
    - more container per host
    - faster start-up/download time - base layers are cached

## Lab overview
In this lab, build on your knowledge from Lab 1 where you used Docker commands to run containers. Create a custom Docker image built from a Dockerfile. After you build the image, you will push it to a central registry where it can be pulled to be deployed on other environments.

Also, you'll get a brief understanding of image layers and how Docker incorporates copy-on-write and the union file system to efficiently store images and run containers. You will use a few Docker commands in this lab. See the documentation on for information on available commands.


## Create and build docker image

If you don't have Python installed locally, don't worry because you don't need it. One of the advantages of using Docker containers is that you can build Python into your containers without having Python installed on your host.

1. Create a file named Dockerfile using the touch command. This will create an empty Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is basically a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

touch Dockerfile

2. Add the following content to the Dockerfile . Click Editor button in the instance window to see the Dockerfile. Select the Dockerfile below the root folder and add the add the following content within it

FROM python:3.6.1-alpine
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install flask
CMD ["python","app.py"]
COPY app.py /app.py
Please see the screenshot below.



Let's understand the commands in the Dockerfile line by line.

FROM python:3.6.1-alpine
This is the starting point for your Dockerfile. Every Dockerfile typically starts with a FROM line that is the starting image to build your layers on top of. In this case, you are selecting the python:3.6.1-alpine base layer because it already has the version of Python and pip that you need to run your application. The alpine version means that it uses the alpine distribution, which is significantly smaller than an alternative flavor of Linux. A smaller image means it will download (deploy) much faster, and it is also more secure because it has a smaller attack surface.

Here you are using the 3.6.1-alpine tag for the Python image. Look at the available tags for the official Python image on the Docker Hub. It is best practice to use a specific tag when inheriting a parent image so that changes to the parent dependency are controlled. If no tag is specified, the latest tag takes effect, which acts as a dynamic pointer that points to the latest version of an image.

For security reasons, you must understand the layers that you build your docker image on top of. For that reason, it is highly recommended to only use official images found in the Docker Hub, or noncommunity images found in the Docker Store. These images are vetted to meet certain security requirements, and also have very good documentation for users to follow. You can find more information about this Python base image and other images that you can use on the Docker store.

For a more complex application, you might need to use a FROM image that is higher up the chain. For example, the parent Dockerfile for your Python application starts with FROM alpine, then specifies a series of CMD and RUN commands for the image. If you needed more control, you could start with FROM alpine (or a different distribution) and run those steps yourself. However, to start, it's recommended that you use an official image that closely matches your needs.

RUN pip install flask
The RUN command executes commands needed to set up your image for your application, such as installing packages, editing files, or changing file permissions. In this case, you are installing Flask. The RUN commands are executed at build time and are added to the layers of your image.

CMD ["python","app.py"]
CMD is the command that is executed when you start a container. Here, you are using CMD to run your Python applcation.

There can be only one CMD per Dockerfile. If you specify more than one CMD, then the last CMD will take effect. The parent python:3.6.1-alpine also specifies a CMD (CMD python2). You can look at the Dockerfile for the official python:alpine image.

You can use the official Python image directly to run Python scripts without installing Python on your host. However, in this case, you are creating a custom image to include your source so that you can build an image with your application and ship it to other environments.

COPY app.py /app.py
This line copies the app.py file in the local directory (where you will run docker image build) into a new layer of the image. This instruction is the last line in the Dockerfile. Layers that change frequently, such as copying source code into the image, should be placed near the bottom of the file to take full advantage of the Docker layer cache. This allows you to avoid rebuilding layers that could otherwise be cached. For instance, if there was a change in the FROM instruction, it will invalidate the cache for all subsequent layers of this image. You'll see this little later in this lab.

It seems counter-intuitive to put this line after the CMD ["python","app.py"] line. Remember, the CMD line is executed only when the container is started, so you won't get a file not found error here.

And there you have it: a very simple Dockerfile. See the full list of commands that you can put into a Dockerfile. Now that you've defined the Dockerfile, you'll use it to build your custom docker image.

3. Click on Save and close the Editor window.

4. Return to terminal in the instance window and type the command given below. You can verify the contents of the Dockerfile within the terminal window.

vi Dockerfile
5. Now enter the command below  and press <Enter>  to close the Dockerfile opened within the terminal.

:wq
6. Now that you've defined the Dockerfile, you'll use it to build your custom docker image.

7. Build the Docker image. Pass in the -t parameter to name your image python-hello-world . 

Note : You need to copy the entire commnad till the ‚Äò  . ‚Äò at the end of command ‚Äì this is required and indicates the root path

$ docker image build -t python-hello-world .

8. Verify that your image shows in your image list:
$ docker image ls

REPOSITORY           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
python-hello-world   latest              f1b2781b3111        26 seconds ago      99.3MB
python               3.6.1-alpine        c86415c03c37        8 days ago          88.7MB
Notice that your base image, python:3.6.1-alpine, is also in your list.

## Run docker image
Now that you have built the image, you can run it to see that it works.

Run the Docker image:

$ docker run -p 5001:5000 -d python-hello-world
0b2ba61df37fb4038d9ae5d145740c63c2c211ae2729fc27dc01b82b5aaafa26
The -p flag maps a port running inside the container to your host. In this case, you're mapping the Python app running on port 5000 inside the container to port 5001 on your host. Note that if port 5001 is already being used by another application on your host, you might need to replace 5001 with another value, such as 5002.

Navigate to http://localhost:5001 in a browser to see the results.

You should see "hello world!" in your browser.



Check the log output of the container.

If you want to see logs from your application, you can use the docker container logs command. By default, docker container logs prints out what is sent to standard out by your application. Use the command docker container ls to find the ID for your running container.

$ docker container logs [container id] 
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
172.17.0.1 - - [28/Jun/2017 19:35:33] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
The Dockerfile is used to create reproducible builds for your application. A common workflow is to have your CI/CD automation run docker image build as part of its build process. After images are built, they will be sent to a central registry where they can be accessed by all environments (such as a test environment) that need to run instances of that application. In the next section, you will push your custom image to the public Docker registry, which is the Docker Hub, where it can be consumed by other developers and operators.
