# 🧠 Study Notes Vault 📚✨  
> Because losing notes once was enough pain for a lifetime

## Welcome!

Hey there! This repo is my **digital brain dump** — a cozy little spot on the internet where I store all my study notes so they don’t get lost, deleted, or accidentally sacrificed to the tech gods again 😅

I once lost all my notes on UX, React, and even SCSS... and let's just say, I felt *user-unfriendly*. So from now on, **everything I learn goes here**. No more second chances, USBs, or randomly named `.docx` files hiding in the Downloads folder.
