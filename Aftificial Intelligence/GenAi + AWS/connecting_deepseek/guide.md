# Get Started with Generative AI

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. Like all artificial intelligence, generative AI is powered by machine learning modelsâ€”very large models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data and commonly referred to as foundation models (FMs). Apart from content creation, generative AI is also used to improve the quality of digital images, edit video, build prototypes quickly for manufacturing, augment data with synthetic datasets, and more.

## Using DeepSeek models 

---
This demo notebook shows how to interact with a deployed DeepSeek model endpoint on Amazon SageMaker AI by using the SageMaker Python SDK for text generation. DeepSeek models are known for their strong performance, particularly in coding and reasoning tasks. We show several example prompt engineering use cases, including code generation, question answering, and controlled model output.

Note: This notebook assumes you've already deployed a DeepSeek model to a SageMaker endpoint. You connect to this existing endpoint.
