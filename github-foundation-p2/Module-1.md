# Module 1: Contribute to an open-source project on GitHub

## Unit 1: Introduction
Open-source software relies heavily on the community for its long-term sustainability. One way to contribute to open-source projects is by making contributions to the project's repository and conducting code reviews.

Suppose you've been using open-source libraries for your projects and at work for quite some time. In the spirit of open source, you've decided to contribute back to some of these libraries and frameworks.
