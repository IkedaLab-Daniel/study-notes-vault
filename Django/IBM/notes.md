## üìä Introduction to Data and Databases

### üß† What is Data?
- Data is a **collection of facts** in the form of:
  - Words
  - Numbers
  - Pictures
- Used everywhere: banks, credit card companies, PayPal, etc.
- Data is **critical**, so it must be:
  - **Secure**
  - **Easily stored**
  - **Quickly accessible**

---

### üóÉÔ∏è What is a Database?
- A **database** is a collection of organized data used for:
  - Input
  - Storage
  - Search & Retrieval
  - Modification

---

### üõ†Ô∏è What is a DBMS?
- **DBMS** (Database Management System) is a set of programs that:
  - Creates and maintains databases
  - Allows **querying** to store, extract, and modify data

#### üß™ Example Use of Querying:
> Find all customers inactive for 6+ months using a query ‚Üí DBMS fetches and returns the matching records.

- Though **Database** and **DBMS** are technically different, they are often used interchangeably.

### üß© Types of Databases

| Type              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Relational (RDBMS)** | Tabular data (rows & columns), follows strict schema |
| **Non-Relational (NoSQL)** | Schema-less, flexible, handles large and diverse datasets |

---

### üßÆ Relational Databases (RDBMS)

- Based on **flat files**, but more powerful
- Organize data in **tables**
- Follow a **defined schema**
- Optimized for **large datasets** and **multi-table operations**
- Use **SQL (Structured Query Language)** for querying

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

- Also called **"Not Only SQL"**
- Designed for:
  - **Volume** of big data
  - **Diversity** of data types
  - **Speed** and **scalability**
- Ideal for:
  - Cloud computing
  - IoT (Internet of Things)
  - Social media platforms
- Store data in a **schema-less** format
- Known for **high flexibility and performance**

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

- **Data** is a valuable digital asset used by businesses everywhere.
- A **database** organizes and stores this data for fast access and updates.
- A **DBMS** is a software system that manages databases using **queries**.
- Two main types of databases:
  - **Relational (SQL)**: Structured, tabular data
  - **Non-relational (NoSQL)**: Flexible, big data-ready
