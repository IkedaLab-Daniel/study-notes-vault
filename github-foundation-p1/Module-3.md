# Module 3: Introduction to GitHub's products

## Unit 1: Introduction
Whether you're just learning to code, working as a developer at a start-up, or a C-level executive at a Fortune 500 company, the GitHub platform can help you build, scale, and deliver secure software.

Depending on your specific situation, it's important to know what GitHub plans fit your needs.

In this module, you learn about the many different types of GitHub accounts, plans, and their associated features. You also discover how other features are licensed.

## Unit 2: Github Accounts and Plans

### Github Account Types
It's important to understand that there's a difference between the types of GitHub accounts and the GitHub plans. Here are the three types of GitHub accounts:

- Personal
- Organization
- Enterprise

### Personal
Every person who uses GitHub.com signs into a personal account (sometimes referred to as a user account). Your personal/user account is your identity on GitHub.com and has a username and profile.

Your personal/user account can own resources such as repositories, packages, and projects and has a straightforward way to manage your permission. Actions that you take on GitHub.com, such as creating an issue or reviewing a pull request, are attributed to your personal account.

Each personal account uses either GitHub Free or GitHub Pro. All personal accounts can own an unlimited number of public and private repositories, with an unlimited number of collaborators on those repositories. If you use GitHub Free, private repositories owned by your personal account have a limited feature set.

### Organization accounts
Organization accounts are shared accounts where an unlimited number of people can collaborate across many projects at once. Unlike personal/user accounts, permissions with organization accounts are done with a tiered approach.

Similar to personal accounts, organizations can own resources such as repositories, packages, and projects. However, you can't sign into an organization. Instead, each person signs into their own personal account, and any actions the person takes on organization resources are attributed to their personal account. Each personal account can be a member of multiple organizations.

The personal accounts within an organization can be given different roles in the organization to grant different levels of access to the organization and its data. All members can collaborate with each other in repositories and projects. But only organization owners and security managers can manage the settings for the organization and control access to the organization's data with sophisticated security and administrative features.

### Enterprise accounts
Enterprise accounts on GitHub.com allow administrators to centrally manage policies and billing for multiple organizations and enable inner sourcing between their organizations. An enterprise account must have a handle, like an organization or user account on GitHub.

Organizations are shared accounts for enterprise members to collaborate across many projects at once. In the enterprise settings, enterprise owners can invite existing organizations to join your enterprise account, transfer organizations between enterprise accounts, or create new organizations.

Your enterprise account allows you to manage and enforce policies for all the organizations owned by the enterprise. Each enterprise policy controls the options available for a policy at the organization level.

### GitHub plans
Now that you have a better understanding of the different types of accounts you can have with GitHub, let's look at the different plans available to improve your software management process and team collaboration.

There are several free GitHub products, in addition to the paid ones:
- GitHub Free for personal accounts and organizations
- GitHub Pro for personal accounts
- GitHub Team
- GitHub Enterprise

### GitHub Free

Here are a few of the many things you can do with GitHub Desktop:
- Add and clone repositories.
- Add changes to your commit interactively.
- Quickly add coauthors to your commit.
- Check out branches with pull requests and view CI statuses.
- Compare changed images.

## Unit 4: Github Billing
GitHub bills separately for each account. You receive a separate bill for your personal account and for each organization or enterprise account you own.

The bill for each account is a combination of charges for your subscriptions and usage-based billing.

- Subscriptions include your account's plan, such as GitHub Pro or GitHub Team, and paid products that have a consistent monthly cost, such as GitHub Copilot and apps from GitHub Marketplace.
- Usage-based billing applies when the cost of a paid product depends on how much you use the product. For example, the cost of GitHub Actions depends on how many minutes your jobs spend running and how much storage your artifacts use.

Your plan might come with included amounts of usage-based products. For example, with GitHub Pro, your personal account gets 3,000 minutes of GitHub Actions usage for free each month. You can control usage beyond the included amounts by setting spending limits.

Understanding GitHub's billing structures is crucial for effective administration and cost management. This document focuses on differentiating how GitHub products are billed, including seat licenses, GitHub Actions, GitHub Packages, and the new billing platform's capabilities.

### Pricing for GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions enables automation of workflows directly within repositories. Its pricing model varies based on repository visibility and account type:

Public Repositories: Usage of GitHub Actions is free for public repositories, providing unlimited minutes on GitHub-hosted runners.

Private Repositories: Each account receives a certain amount of free minutes and storage for GitHub-hosted runners, depending on the account's plan. For example, GitHub Free for personal accounts includes 2,000 CI/CD minutes per month. Usage beyond the included amounts is controlled by spending limits.

### Pricing and Support Options for Organizations
GitHub offers various plans tailored to organizational needs, each with distinct features and support options:

GitHub Free for Organizations:

### Usage-Based Billing for Licenses (Metered Billing)
With the enhanced billing platform, GitHub has introduced a usage-based billing model for licenses:

- Monthly Billing: Organizations are billed monthly for the exact number of GitHub Enterprise and GitHub Advanced Security licenses used.

-Pro Rata Charges: If a user starts consuming a license partway through the month, the organization is charged a pro rata amount for that user's usage.

- Dynamic Adjustments: If a user stops consuming a license during the month, the billing for the following month reflects this change, ensuring organizations only pay for active users.

This model eliminates the need to purchase a predefined number of licenses in advance, offering flexibility and cost efficiency.

### Billing Platform’s New Capabilities
GitHub's enhanced billing platform provides improved tools for financial management:

- Granular Spending Controls: Administrators can set specific spending limits for services like GitHub Actions and GitHub Packages, preventing unexpected overages.

- Detailed Usage Insights: The platform offers in-depth visibility into product usage, allowing organizations to monitor consumption patterns and optimize resource allocation.

- Automated Reporting: Features for automating usage reporting streamline financial oversight and facilitate internal chargebacks.

These capabilities enhance an organization's ability to manage expenses effectively and align GitHub usage with budgetary constraints.

## Unit 5: License Usage Stats
As a GitHub Enterprise administrator, tracking license usage is crucial for managing costs, optimizing resources, and ensuring compliance. GitHub provides various methods for obtaining license statistics at organization, enterprise, and instance levels.

### Finding License Usage for a Specific Organization
To find license usage statistics for a single GitHub organization:

- Method 1: Using GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) Admin Console
- Method 2: Finding License Usage Across Multiple Organizations
- Method 3: Finding License Usage for Enterprise Accounts
- Method 4: Finding License Usage Across Multiple GitHub Instances

### Best Practices for License Usage Management
The following strategies can help you manage licenses more efficiently across your organization:
- Automate Monitoring: Use GraphQL/REST API queries to track usage trends.
- Optimize Unused Seats: Identify inactive users and reclaim unused licenses.
- Enable Usage-Based Billing: Ensure billing reflects actual consumption.
- Regular Audits: Conduct monthly/quarterly license reviews to optimize cost.

## Unit 6: License Usage Stats in Machine and Peripheral Devices
Tracking license usage is essential for cost optimization and security compliance. Machine accounts (used for automation) and peripheral services (such as CI/CD, integrations, and API consumers) can consume licenses, impacting enterprise costs and resource management.

### Understanding Machine Accounts and Peripheral Services

#### Machine Account
Machine accounts are GitHub accounts used for automation, running scripts, or integrating with third-party tools.

Characteristics: - They act independently of human users. - Often used by CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI). - Each machine account consumes a GitHub licens

#### Peripheral Services
Peripheral Services are external integrations that interact with GitHub via API requests.

Examples: - CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitHub Runners, Jenkins). - Security Scanning Tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk, CodeQL). - Third-party Integrations (e.g., Slack, Jira, Datadog). - Self-hosted GitHub Runners.

Why Track These?
- To identify unused or excessive licenses.
- To optimize costs and prevent unnecessary spending.
- To monitor security risks from inactive or misconfigured automation accounts.

### Finding License Usage Statistics for Machine Accounts
- Method 1: GitHub Enterprise Admin Console
- Method 2: GraphQL API Query for Machine Accounts


### Finding License Usage for Peripheral Services
- Method 1: GitHub Actions & Runners Usage Metrics
- Method 2: REST API for Self-Hosted Runners
- Method 3: Peripheral Services API Usage Tracking

### Best Practices for Managing Machine Accounts & Peripheral Services Licenses
Audit Machine Accounts Regularly: Identify and deactivate unused machine accounts.
- Over time, organizations accumulate unused or stale machine accounts that may still have access to repositories and systems.
- Unused accounts increase security risks, as they can be exploited if compromised.
- Regular audits ensure that only active and necessary machine accounts exist, reducing exposure to unauthorized access.

Monitor API Usage: Track third-party tools consuming enterprise licenses.
- Many third-party applications, CI/CD pipelines, and integrations consume GitHub API resources and enterprise licenses.
- Excessive API calls can lead to rate limits, affecting developers' workflows.
- Unauthorized or unknown API usage can expose sensitive data and security vulnerabilities.

Optimize Runner Usage: Identify idle self-hosted runners and reduce GitHub-hosted runner costs.
- Self-hosted and GitHub-hosted runners execute CI/CD workflows. Inefficient use leads to unnecessary costs.
- Idle self-hosted runners waste computing resources and may expose organizations to security risks if left unmonitored.
- GitHub-hosted runners operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, and optimizing usage can significantly reduce costs.

Restrict Machine Accounts: Limit their permissions and enforce security policies.
- Machine accounts should not have unnecessary access to repositories, reducing the risk of privilege escalation.
- If compromised, machine accounts can be exploited to manipulate source code, deploy malicious changes, or expose secrets.
- Enforcing security policies helps ensure compliance and minimizes potential breaches.

Tracking license usage for machine accounts and peripheral services is crucial for cost optimization, security, and compliance in GitHub Enterprise. Admins should leverage GitHub UI, GraphQL, and REST APIs to identify inactive accounts, optimize usage, and prevent unnecessary spending.
