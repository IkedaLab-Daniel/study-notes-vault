# IBM: Generative AI: Prompt Engineering Basics

## What Is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is any input or series of instructions given to a generative AI model to produce a desired output. It guides the model’s behavior, helping it generate responses that are relevant, logical, creative, and human-like.

### 🔑 Key Concepts:

#### ✅ What Is a Prompt?

* An **instruction** you give to a generative model.
* Examples:

  * *“Write a small paragraph describing your favorite holiday destination.”*
  * *“Write HTML code to generate a dropdown selection of cities.”*

### 🧱 Elements of an Effective Prompt:

1. **Instruction**

   * Clearly defines what you want the model to do.
   * *Example*: “Write an essay in 600 words analyzing the effects of global warming on marine life.”

2. **Context**

   * Sets the background or scenario for the prompt.
   * *Example with context*:
     “In recent decades, global warming has undergone significant shifts… Write an essay analyzing the effects on marine life.”

3. **Input Data**

   * Provides supporting information for the model to refer to.
   * *Example*:
     “You have been provided with a dataset containing temperature records… Write an essay analyzing the effects on marine life in the Pacific Ocean.”

4. **Output Indicators**

   * Specifies the format, tone, style, length, etc.
   * *Example*:
     “Write an essay in 600 words…” → sets length and style expectations.

### 🧠 Why Prompt Design Matters:

* **Naive prompting** (e.g., “rich man’s story from small town”) → results in generic outputs.
* **Refined prompting** (e.g., “Write a story about a farmer who became a successful businessman in 10 years”) → leads to more specific and accurate results.

### 📸 Visual Example (Prompt for Image Generation):

* ❌ *“Sunset image between mountains”* → too vague.
* ✅ *“Generate an image depicting a calm sunset over a river valley that rests amidst mountains”* → clearer, more vivid.
