## Python with Flask for Large-Scale Projects
Python with Flask is a lightweight and flexible web application framework. It's known for its simplicity, minimalism, and ease of use. It is designed as a micro-framework providing a lightweight structure which facilitates developers in building a web application quickly and easily but not compromising on the efficiency and ability to scale up from small-scale projects to larger, more complex applications.

Flask is a good choice for smaller, simpler applications. However, 'micro' has more to do with what Flask is, rather than limiting its scalability potential. Flask can be used for large-scale systems and more complex applications with attention to specific requirements and constraints, careful planning, good architecture, and modular design, but it may require more effort to manage and scale compared to more robust and feature-rich frameworks.

Its rich and robust ecosystem provides developers with tools, libraries, and functionalities to handle web development tasks such as routing, request handling, template rendering or similar tasks. Caching, load-balancing, replication and storing your data in a scalable manner can help achieve optimal results.

## Application Development lifecycle phases
1. Requirement gathering
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Code and test
5. User and system testing
6. Production
7. Maintenance

## Maintain multiple file
- Requirements for functionalities vary
- Best Practice: Code each functionality in a seperate file
    - Make code maintainance efficient and easy
    - Helps when new functionality is added

## Using Spaces for Indentation
**PEP8 Guidelines**
- Use 4 spaces is recommended than Tab
    - for appropriate readability
- Use blank lines to seperate functions and classes
