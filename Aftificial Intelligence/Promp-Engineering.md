# IBM: Generative AI: Prompt Engineering Basics

## What Is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is any input or series of instructions given to a generative AI model to produce a desired output. It guides the model‚Äôs behavior, helping it generate responses that are relevant, logical, creative, and human-like.

### üîë Key Concepts:

#### ‚úÖ What Is a Prompt?

* An **instruction** you give to a generative model.
* Examples:

  * *‚ÄúWrite a small paragraph describing your favorite holiday destination.‚Äù*
  * *‚ÄúWrite HTML code to generate a dropdown selection of cities.‚Äù*

---

### üß± Elements of an Effective Prompt:

1. **Instruction**

   * Clearly defines what you want the model to do.
   * *Example*: ‚ÄúWrite an essay in 600 words analyzing the effects of global warming on marine life.‚Äù

2. **Context**

   * Sets the background or scenario for the prompt.
   * *Example with context*:
     ‚ÄúIn recent decades, global warming has undergone significant shifts‚Ä¶ Write an essay analyzing the effects on marine life.‚Äù

3. **Input Data**

   * Provides supporting information for the model to refer to.
   * *Example*:
     ‚ÄúYou have been provided with a dataset containing temperature records‚Ä¶ Write an essay analyzing the effects on marine life in the Pacific Ocean.‚Äù

4. **Output Indicators**

   * Specifies the format, tone, style, length, etc.
   * *Example*:
     ‚ÄúWrite an essay in 600 words‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí sets length and style expectations.

### üß† Why Prompt Design Matters:

* **Naive prompting** (e.g., ‚Äúrich man‚Äôs story from small town‚Äù) ‚Üí results in generic outputs.
* **Refined prompting** (e.g., ‚ÄúWrite a story about a farmer who became a successful businessman in 10 years‚Äù) ‚Üí leads to more specific and accurate results.

### üì∏ Visual Example (Prompt for Image Generation):

* ‚ùå *‚ÄúSunset image between mountains‚Äù* ‚Üí too vague.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúGenerate an image depicting a calm sunset over a river valley that rests amidst mountains‚Äù* ‚Üí clearer, more vivid.

## What Is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is the structured process of crafting precise and effective prompts to guide generative AI models to produce accurate, relevant, and useful outputs.

### üîë What Is Prompt Engineering?

> Prompt engineering is the **design** of input instructions (prompts) to achieve **better and desired responses** from generative AI.

* It involves **critical thinking**, **creativity**, and **technical skill**.
* A poorly written prompt can lead to **incomplete**, **inaccurate**, or even **misleading** outputs.
* A well-engineered prompt guides the AI to perform tasks effectively and ethically.

### ‚öì Example Scenario: The Ship Captain

* ‚ùå Poor Prompt:
  `"Weather forecast of the Atlantic Ocean."`
  (Too broad ‚Üí produces vague results.)

* ‚úÖ Engineered Prompt:
  `"Provide weather forecasts for 28th Aug to 1st Sep 2023 for coordinates 20¬∞N‚Äì30¬∞N, 40¬∞W‚Äì20¬∞W in the Atlantic Ocean, including wind patterns, wave height, storm probability, etc."`
  (Specific location, time, and data needs.)

### üß± Prompt Engineering Process:

1. **Define the Goal**

   * Clearly outline what you want the model to generate.
   * *E.g.* ‚ÄúSummarize benefits and risks of AI in automobiles.‚Äù

2. **Craft Initial Prompt**

   * Translate the goal into a clear instruction.
   * *E.g.* ‚ÄúWrite an article about pros and cons of AI in the automobile industry.‚Äù

3. **Test the Prompt**

   * Run the prompt and evaluate the model‚Äôs response.
   * Check for missing depth, context, or scope.

4. **Analyze the Response**

   * Identify gaps: Did it meet the objective? Was the tone right? What was missing?

5. **Refine the Prompt**

   * Add context, rephrase, or include specific domains.
   * *E.g.* Add instructions to cover ethics, cybersecurity, autonomous driving, etc.

6. **Iterate**

   * Repeat testing and refining until the response meets expectations.

### ‚úÖ Final Refined Prompt Example:

> *‚ÄúWrite an article highlighting how artificial intelligence is reshaping the automobile industry. Focus on positive advancements such as autonomous driving and real-time traffic analysis. Also discuss technical challenges like decision-making algorithms and cybersecurity threats. Emphasize how these concerns impact vehicle safety. Include examples and promote critical thinking.‚Äù*

### üåü Importance of Prompt Engineering

* **Optimizes Model Efficiency**
  Get the best results *without retraining* the model.

* **Boosts Task-Specific Performance**
  Fine-tuned prompts produce *context-aware* and *nuanced* results.

* **Reveals Model Strengths & Limitations**
  Helps improve future designs and updates.

* **Improves AI Safety**
  Reduces the chance of *harmful or biased outputs* by controlling inputs precisely.
