* Accessible through a standard web browser with temporary credentials provided.
* Includes instructions, live scenarios, and free credits for lab use.
* Labs must be **started and ended properly** (using Start Lab and End Lab buttons).

### Skill Badges Earned

By completing labs and challenge labs, learners can earn the following badges:

* **Implement Load Balancing on Compute Engine**
* **Set Up an App Dev Environment on Google Cloud**
* **Build a Secure Google Cloud Network**
* **Prepare Data for ML APIs on Google Cloud**

Each badge involves hands-on labs leading to a **final Challenge Lab** as a capstone.
