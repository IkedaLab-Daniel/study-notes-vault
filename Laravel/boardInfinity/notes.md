## **What is Laravel?**

* **Open-source PHP framework** created by **Taylor Otwell**.
* Uses **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architecture to separate:

  * **Model** → Data
  * **View** → User interface
  * **Controller** → Business logic
* Based on **Symfony** components.
* Designed for **developer friendliness** with strong documentation.

## **Setting Up Laravel Development Environment**

### **Prerequisites**

* **PHP**
* **Composer**
* **Web server** (Apache recommended)
* **Database** (MySQL for this exercise)
* Add dependencies to **environment variables** for easy terminal access.

---

### **Setup Steps**

1. **Create a directory** for Laravel projects.
2. **Install Laravel installer globally**:

   ```bash
   composer global require laravel/installer
   ```
3. **Create a new project**:

   ```bash
   laravel new demo_project
   ```
4. **Choose options**:

   * Starter kits (optional) – authentication system or none.
   * Testing framework – PHP Unit (commonly preferred).
   * Git repository – optional initialization.
5. Laravel automatically:

   * Generates a project structure with basic code architecture.
   * Runs `php artisan key:generate`.
   * Prompts for database selection (MySQL in this example).

### **Laravel Project Structure Overview**

#### **1. `app/`**

* **Heart of the application** — contains most of your custom code.
* **`Http/`**

  * **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
  * **Middleware**: Filter requests before they reach your application.
* **`Providers/`**: Service providers that bind classes and perform tasks during bootstrapping.
* **`Console/`**: Your custom Artisan commands.
* **`Exceptions/`**: Custom exception classes to handle and categorize errors.

---

#### **2. `bootstrap/`**

* Holds files needed to **bootstrap the Laravel application**.
* **`app.php`**: Initializes the app and loads service providers.

---

#### **3. `config/`**

* Stores all **configuration files** for Laravel components (e.g., database connections, mail settings, cache).

---

#### **4. `public/`**

* **Web-accessible directory** — the entry point of your application.
* **`index.php`**: Main entry point for all incoming requests.
* **`favicon.ico`**: The site’s favicon.

---

### **Tips from the video**

1. **Use namespaces** to organize code for easier access.
2. Stick to Laravel’s given folder structure (controllers, models, views already separated).
3. Use **descriptive file and folder names**.
4. **Document your code** so you (and others) can understand it later.

## Laravel Routing, Controllers, and Views

* **Routing** matches incoming requests to specific code in your application.
* Defined using the `Route` class methods (e.g., `Route::get()` for HTTP GET requests).
* Routes are stored in the **`routes/`** directory:

  * **`web.php`**: For web interface routes, includes session state & CSRF protection.
  * **`api.php`**: For stateless API routes with API middleware group.
* Example: `Route::get('/user', function () { return 'User loaded'; });`
* **Artisan CLI** (`php artisan serve`) runs the local development server.
* **Views** are returned using the `view()` function, stored in **`resources/views/`** as Blade templates (`.blade.php`).
* Data can be passed from routes/controllers to views for dynamic HTML output.

## Laravel Controllers and Views

* **Controllers** handle incoming HTTP requests, perform tasks (e.g., retrieving data, validating input), and return responses.
* **Views** generate HTML for the user; Blade templates enable dynamic content generation.
* Tips:

  * Use dependency injection for testable, reusable code.
  * Use view composers to pass common data to multiple views.
  * Document controllers and views for maintainability.
* Controller methods handle specific routes (e.g., GET `/user` or POST `/login`).
* Logic should be in controllers, keeping route files clean.
* Create controllers with `php artisan make:controller`.
* Map routes to controller methods using `[Controller::class, 'method']`.
* Pass data from controllers to views (e.g., fetching user data from DB).
* Use **migrations** (`php artisan migrate`) to create tables and **seeders** (`php artisan db:seed`) to populate initial data.
* Ensure proper imports for models, controllers, and routes to avoid errors.

## Laravel Views Summary

Views in Laravel are Blade templates used to generate the HTML shown to users. To use a view, you return it from a controller method using the `view()` function, which typically takes two parameters:

1. **View name** – e.g., `user.profile` refers to `resources/views/user/profile.blade.php`.
2. **Data array** – key-value pairs, such as `['user' => $user]`, where `$user` is retrieved from the controller (often from the database).

Blade templates can access these passed variables and display their properties (e.g., `{{ $user->name }}`). You can enhance the display with HTML tags like `<h1>` to style the output.

## Laravel Database Migrations & Eloquent ORM Summary

Database migrations and Eloquent ORM simplify database schema management and data interaction.

* **Migrations**

  * Located in `database/migrations/`.
  * Create and modify tables with version control.
  * Contain `up()` (apply changes) and `down()` (revert changes).
  * Run using `php artisan migrate`.
  * Use descriptive names for clarity.
  * Default scripts create core tables like `users` with constraints and nullable fields.

* **Eloquent ORM**

  * Model classes map to database tables.
  * Define `$fillable` and `$hidden` attributes for mass assignment and JSON visibility.
  * Extend Laravel’s `Authenticatable` or `Model` base classes.
  * Use relationships to define table associations.
  * Scopes help filter and sort data efficiently.

* **Seeders & Factories**

  * Populate tables with initial or test data.
  * Factories generate multiple random records (e.g., 10 users).

**Best Practices:**

* Keep model and table names consistent.
* Document migrations and models.
* Use relationships and scopes for cleaner queries.

## Laravel Eloquent ORM Summary

Eloquent ORM is Laravel’s built-in object-relational mapper that allows interaction with the database using PHP objects instead of raw SQL.

* **Model Basics**

  * Each database table typically has a corresponding model class in `app/Models/`.
  * Models extend `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`.
  * Created with `php artisan make:model ModelName`.
  * Can explicitly set the `$table` property to match the database table.

* **Core Operations**

  * `all()` – retrieve all records.
  * `find($id)` – retrieve a record by ID.
  * Supports creating, updating, and deleting records.
  * Allows complex queries via Eloquent’s query builder.

* **Integration with Migrations & Seeders**

  * Migrations define and create the table schema.
  * Seeders populate tables with test or initial data (`php artisan db:seed --class=SeederName`).
  * If a table is missing, run or refresh migrations (`php artisan migrate:refresh`).

* **Controller Usage**

  * Import models into controllers.
  * Use Eloquent methods inside controller actions to fetch and manipulate data.
  * Ensure model property names match migration column definitions.

* **Best Practices**

  * Keep column and attribute names consistent.
  * Validate data before saving.
  * Use Eloquent relationships for linked tables.
  * Leverage scopes for reusable query filters.

## **Routing in Laravel**

**Routing** in Laravel is the process of defining how the application responds to HTTP requests. It determines which controller method or closure should be executed for a given URL.

### **Key Routing Concepts:**

* **Route Definition**
  * Laravel provides a clear and expressive way to define routes in the `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php` file
  * You can specify the URL, HTTP method, and the controller method or closure that should handle the request

* **Named Routes**
  * You can give names to routes for easier referencing in your application
  * Named routes are useful for generating URLs and links in your views and controllers

* **Route Parameters**
  * You can define route parameters that allow you to capture parts of the URL and pass them to your controller methods
  * This is useful for creating dynamic routes

* **Middleware**
  * Middleware can be applied to routes to filter HTTP requests entering your application
  * It's often used for authentication, authorization, and other request filtering tasks

* **Route Groups**
  * You can group routes together with common middleware and namespaces
  * Makes it easier to manage related routes

> Laravel's routing system is flexible and powerful, allowing you to create clean and organized routes for your application.

## **Controllers and Views in Laravel**

Controllers and views are essential components of the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern in Laravel:

### **Controllers**
* In Laravel, controllers handle the application's HTTP requests
* They contain methods that correspond to different routes and are responsible for processing data and returning responses
* Controllers help keep your application logic separate from your routes

### **Views**
* Views are responsible for presenting the data to the user
* In Laravel, views are typically written in **Blade**, a templating engine that simplifies the creation of dynamic and data-driven views
* You can pass data from controllers to views to render dynamic content

### **MVC Architecture**
* Laravel promotes the separation of concerns through the MVC pattern:
  * **Models** → Represent the data and the database
  * **Controllers** → Handle the application logic
  * **Views** → Responsible for displaying the data

### **Additional Features**

* **Resource Controllers**
  * Laravel provides resource controllers that simplify the handling of common CRUD operations
  * (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for resources like articles, users, or products

* **Blade Templates**
  * Blade templates are a powerful feature for creating dynamic and reusable views
  * Blade allows you to include sub-views, conditionals, loops, and more within your HTML templates

> Controllers and views work in tandem to create a structured and organized approach to handling HTTP requests and rendering web pages in Laravel.

## **Database Migrations and Eloquent ORM**

Laravel offers an elegant way to interact with databases through database migrations and the Eloquent Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system:

### **Database Migrations**
* Migrations are a **version control system** for your database schema
* With migrations, you can define and modify your database structure using PHP code instead of SQL queries
* Migrations are especially useful when collaborating with other developers and deploying updates

### **Eloquent ORM**
* Eloquent is Laravel's implementation of the **Active Record pattern**
* It allows you to interact with your database using a simple and expressive syntax
* Eloquent models represent database tables and make it easy to perform CRUD operations, define relationships, and validate data

### **Additional Database Tools**

* **Model Factories**
  * Laravel's model factories allow you to generate dummy data for your application
  * Makes it easier to test and seed your database with sample data

* **Database Seeding**
  * Database seeding is the process of populating your database with initial data
  * Laravel's database seeder makes it straightforward to create records for testing or bootstrapping your application

## Laravel Middleware

Middleware in Laravel allows intercepting and filtering HTTP requests before they reach controllers, enabling tasks like authentication, authorization, logging, and request validation.

* **Creating Middleware**

  * Use `php artisan make:middleware Name` to generate a middleware class.
  * Middleware contains a `handle` method that receives the request, performs checks/changes, and then calls `$next($request)` to pass it forward.

* **Registering Middleware**

  * In `app/Http/Kernel.php`:

    * **Global Middleware** – runs on all requests.
    * **Middleware Groups** – e.g., `web` for browser requests, `api` for API requests.
    * **Route Middleware (aliases)** – assign names to middleware for route-specific use.

* **Using Middleware in Routes**

  * Apply to routes in `routes/web.php` using `->middleware('aliasName')`.

* **Example Implementation**

  * Middleware checks request headers (e.g., `User-Agent`).
  * Blocks certain browsers by redirecting to an "unauthorized" view if the condition matches.
  * Logs events using Laravel’s `Log` class (`error`, `warning`, `debug`, etc.).

* **Best Practices**

  * Keep middleware focused on one responsibility.
  * Use global middleware for app-wide concerns, and route middleware for specific features.
  * Always validate and sanitize incoming request data before processing.
