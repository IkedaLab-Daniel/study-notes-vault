## Introduction to Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) refers to techniques used to improve a website's visibility in organic search results. It is a subset of Search Engine Marketing (SEM), which also includes paid search strategies.

### How Search Engines Work

Search engines use automated bots or crawlers to scan and index web content. This indexed content is stored in a database and retrieved in response to search queries. Key components for ranking include:
- Keywords
- Titles and headings
- Links and overall page structure

A website must be indexed to appear in search results.

### Types of SEO

- **Technical SEO**:  
  Involves backend configurations that assist search engine crawlers. Poor technical SEO can hinder indexing and ranking.

- **On-Page SEO**:  
  Focuses on the content and structure of a webpage. Techniques include:
  - Use of keywords
  - Title and heading optimization
  - Internal linking
  - Image alt tags
  - Structured data markup  
  On-page SEO enhances both usability and search visibility.

- **Off-Page SEO**:  
  Involves external factors like backlinks. High-quality backlinks from trusted sources can improve a site's ranking in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs).

### Benefits of SEO
