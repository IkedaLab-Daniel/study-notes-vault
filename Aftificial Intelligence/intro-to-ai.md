## AI Agents

### What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are software programs that:

* Interact with their environment
* Collect and process data
* Perform tasks autonomously to meet human-defined goals

They are capable of decision-making, problem-solving, adapting to new information, and learning from past experiences.

### How AI Agents Work (Phases)

1. **Perception** – Use sensors to gather environmental data
2. **Understanding** – Process and interpret data
3. **Decision-Making** – Determine the best actions using logic
4. **Action** – Use actuators to carry out decisions
5. **Learning** – Improve over time through machine learning

### Key Characteristics of AI Agents

* **Social Ability**: Communicate and collaborate with others
  *Example*: Healthcare chatbots for advice and scheduling
* **Autonomy**: Operate and make decisions independently
  *Example*: Self-driving cars
* **Reactiveness**: Respond quickly to environmental changes
  *Example*: Thermostats, predictive maintenance
* **Proactiveness**: Take initiative to achieve goals
  *Example*: Smart assistants taking actions based on patterns

### Multi-Agent Systems

* **Definition**: Systems where multiple AI agents work together
* **Capabilities**:

  * Distributed problem-solving
  * Cooperative decision-making
  * Emergent behavior through agent interaction

**Applications**:

* Online marketplaces – Negotiating agents for buyers/sellers
* Robotic coordination – Teamwork in logistics or rescue
* Traffic management – Communicating vehicles to reduce congestion

### Real-World Applications by Tech Giants

* **Google**:

  * YouTube: Content recommendation, moderation
  * Gmail: Smart replies, spam filtering
  * Maps: Real-time navigation and traffic updates
* **Amazon**:

  * Alexa: Voice recognition and smart home control
  * E-commerce: Product recommendation, inventory management
  * AWS: AI services like NLP and computer vision
