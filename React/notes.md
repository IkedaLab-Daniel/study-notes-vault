## Course Context

* Continuation of Complete Intro to React v9, but v5 or older not required.
* Focused on newer React concepts: React Server Components, performance, transitions.
* v5 still valid for Redux/TypeScript.
* Designed as a companion to Intro to React v9.

## Course Structure

### Part 1: React Server & Rendering

* Review client-side React, static site generation, server-side rendering.
* React Server Components (RSCs): without framework and with Next.js.

### Part 2: Performance

* Make apps performant (actual) and feel performant (perceived).

## Audience

* Not for first-time coders or first JavaScript learners.
* Good for those with React fundamentals or Intro to React v9.
* Some Node.js exposure helpful since RSCs need it.
