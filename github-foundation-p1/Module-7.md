# Module 7: Manage your work with GitHub Projects

## Unit 1: Introduction
We know your work is dynamic. Priorities can change quickly and needing to stay current and aware of everything is how you and your team can be successful.

Luckily, GitHub Projects can help you stay organized, connected, and up-to-date in order to keep your team on track.

Projects connect your planning directly to the work your team is doing and flexibly adapts to whatever your team needs at any point. Project tables are built like a spreadsheet and give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use Project tables, Project boards, and custom fields to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.

Learning objectives:
- Discern the differences between Projects and Projects (Classic)
- Learn how to build an organization level Project
- Understand how to organize your Project
- Gain insight on how to edit the visibility, access, and management of your Project
- Know how to develop automation and insights from your Project
