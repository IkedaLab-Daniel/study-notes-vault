# Advanced RAG with Vector Databases and Retrievers

> # Module 1

## Advanced Retrievers and Vector Databases for RAG

* This course focuses on using vector databases and advanced retrievers to build high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.
* You will gain deep expertise in advanced retriever strategies and how they improve the relevance, accuracy, and grounding of LLM-generated responses.
* The course emphasizes practical implementation and comparison of retriever types such as:

  * Multi-query retrievers
  * Self-querying retrievers
  * Parent-document retrievers
* You will learn how retrievers work within LangChain and LlamaIndex and how retrieval strategies directly impact RAG quality.
* The course covers vector database indexing methods, including:

  * Graph-based indexing
  * Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)
  * Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
* You will understand how indexing strategies affect retrieval speed, scalability, and semantic accuracy.
* Hands-on labs guide you in applying and evaluating retrievers using LangChain, LlamaIndex, FAISS, and ChromaDB.
* You will build a complete RAG-powered application using LangChain and Gradio.
* Practical exercises focus on retrieval design, evaluation, and integration with vector databases.
* The course is designed for developers, engineers, data scientists, AI engineers, AI enthusiasts, and computer science students working with LLMs and semantic search.
* Prerequisites include Python programming, familiarity with vector databases, and working knowledge of RAG and similarity search.
* The course consists of two modules:

  * **Module 1: Advanced Retrievers for RAG**

    * Introduction to retrievers in LangChain
    * Standard vector store retrievers and advanced retriever types
    * Hands-on extraction of relevant document chunks
    * Index types and advanced retrievers in LlamaIndex
    * Query Fusion Retriever and fusion strategies
  * **Module 2: Build a Comprehensive RAG Application**

    * Introduction to FAISS and comparison with ChromaDB
    * FAISS index types and extension using Milvus
    * Understanding when to use FAISS vs ChromaDB
    * Semantic similarity search with FAISS
    * Building a YouTube transcript Q&A summarization tool using FAISS and LangChain
* By the end of the course, you will be equipped to build intelligent, scalable, and context-aware RAG systems using advanced retrieval and indexing techniques.
