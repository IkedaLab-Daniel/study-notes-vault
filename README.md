# 🧠 Study Notes Vault 📚✨  
> Because losing notes once was enough pain for a lifetime

## Welcome!

Hey there! This repo is my **digital brain dump** — a cozy little spot on the internet where I store all my study notes so they don’t get lost, deleted, or accidentally sacrificed to the tech gods again 😅

I once lost all my notes on UX, React, and even SCSS... and let's just say, I felt *user-unfriendly*. So from now on, **everything I learn goes here**. No more second chances, USBs, or randomly named `.docx` files hiding in the Downloads folder.

Go ahead! Copy, learn, remix, or print them out and sleep on them (no promises on osmosis learning though).

Just be cool and don’t plagiarize like it’s 2007.
