# Fundamentals of Building AI Agents

> # Module 1: Foundation of Tool Calling and Chaining

## Introduction to AI Agents Course

This course introduces AI agents and their growing importance in modern applications as businesses increasingly rely on intelligent systems that can reason, act, and solve problems in real time. AI agents are used across domains such as customer support, research, law, healthcare, data analysis, and report generation, creating strong demand for developers who can build task-driven, tool-integrated solutions.

The course is designed for aspiring software engineers, data scientists, machine learning engineers, AI architects, and related roles. Strong **Python programming skills** are required, along with recommended familiarity in core AI concepts and the **LangChain** framework.

The curriculum begins by explaining what AI agents are, how they differ from traditional workflows, and when to use them effectively. Learners gain a foundation in **tool calling and chaining** with LangChain, understanding why language models need tools and how function calling improves accuracy. Early activities include building a math assistant by converting functions into tools and orchestrating them with LangChain, as well as exploring LangChain’s built-in agents.

**Module 2** focuses on **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**, a concise, chain-first syntax for creating modular AI workflows. Learners practice manually invoking tools based on LLM outputs, parsing and validating tool calls, and building a tool-calling agent through a hands-on lab.

**Module 3** emphasizes building solutions using LangChain’s built-in agents. Learners create natural language data visualizations and conversational agents that query SQL databases using plain English, implementing two complete agents through guided walkthroughs.

To succeed, learners are encouraged to engage fully with videos, readings, practice quizzes, hands-on labs, and the graded assessment to solidify their understanding of AI agent development.
