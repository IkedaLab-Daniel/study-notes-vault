# Build RAG Applications: Get Started

> # Module 1

## Course Overview: Getting Started with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a high-demand skill with strong career potential, offering competitive salaries and rapid market growth across industries such as healthcare, finance, legal tech, e-commerce, education, and customer service.

### Course Audience & Prerequisites

* Designed for aspiring **AI developers, ML engineers, data scientists, and AI researchers**.
* Requires **Python programming skills** and prior experience.
* Familiarity with **LangChain**, basic AI concepts, and web development is recommended.

### What You Will Learn

* **RAG fundamentals**: How retrieval and generative AI work together to produce accurate, context-aware responses.
* **Hands-on Lab 1**:

  * Use LangChain to split documents, generate embeddings, and build simple retrieval chains.
  * Work in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
* **Hands-on Lab 2**:

  * Build a full RAG application by integrating LangChain with a large language model.
  * Use **Gradio** to create an interactive question-and-answer bot.
* **Final Module**:

  * Explore **LlamaIndex** as an alternative RAG framework.
  * Build an icebreaker bot using **IBM Granite** and LlamaIndex.
  * Learn how to transfer RAG skills across frameworks.

### Key Skills Gained

* End-to-end **RAG pipeline development**
* Working with **vector databases**, embeddings, chunking strategies, retrievers, and prompt templates
* Building **interactive AI applications** using Gradio
* Applying RAG concepts across multiple frameworks (LangChain and LlamaIndex)

### Course Outcome

* A solid understanding of RAG architectures
* Practical experience building real-world RAG applications
* Reusable skills for future GenAI and AI-powered projects
