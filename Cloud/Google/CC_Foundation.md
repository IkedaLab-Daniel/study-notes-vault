## Introduction to Cloud Computing

### Definition

Cloud computing, as defined by the **US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, is a model of using IT resources that has **five key traits**:

1. **On-demand and self-service** – Users can provision computing resources (processing, storage, network) through a web interface without human intervention.
2. **Accessible over the internet** – Resources can be accessed from anywhere with a connection.
3. **Resource pooling** – Providers maintain a large pool of resources, allocate them to users as needed, and achieve cost efficiency through bulk purchasing.
4. **Elasticity** – Resources can scale up or down quickly depending on demand.
5. **Pay-as-you-go** – Customers only pay for what they use or reserve; charges stop when usage stops.

### Infrastructure Analogy

* **Infrastructure** = underlying framework of facilities and systems.
* Example: A **city's infrastructure** includes transportation, power, water, and communication.
* In IT, infrastructure includes the services and systems that support applications and users.

### Google Cloud Focus

* The course will cover **Google Cloud infrastructure services**.
* Learners will gain familiarity with what these services do and how to begin using them.

## Cloud Architecture and Evolution

### From Traditional to Cloud

* **First Wave: Colocation**

  * Users rented **physical space** in data centers instead of owning infrastructure.
  * Provided financial efficiency but still relied on physical servers.

* **Second Wave: Virtualization**

  * Data centers used **virtual devices** (servers, CPUs, disks, load balancers, etc.).
  * Allowed flexibility but enterprises still had to **maintain and configure infrastructure**.

* **Third Wave: Container-Based Cloud (Google’s Model)**

  * Fully **automated, elastic cloud** architecture.
  * Infrastructure provisioning and configuration handled automatically.
  * Enables scalable data and services for faster application deployment.
  * Currently available to Google Cloud customers.

### Google’s Vision

* Future businesses will differentiate through **technology and software**.
* **High-quality data** is central to great software.
* Every company is becoming a **data company**.

### Energy and Sustainability

* Data centers use about **2% of the world’s electricity**.
* Google focuses on **efficiency and sustainability**:

  * First data centers to achieve **ISO 14001 certification** (resource efficiency, waste reduction).
  * Example: **Hamina, Finland Data Center**

    * Uses seawater cooling from the Bay of Finland.
    * First system of its kind globally, reducing energy use.
* Google’s sustainability milestones:

  * **Carbon neutral** in its first decade.
  * **100% renewable energy** in its second decade.
  * Goal: **Carbon-free operations by 2030**.

## IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and Serverless

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

* Provides **raw compute, storage, and networking** resources.
* Organized virtually, similar to a physical data center.
* **Customers pay** for resources they **allocate ahead of time**.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

* Provides **libraries and infrastructure bindings** for applications.
* Developers focus more on **application logic** instead of infrastructure.
* **Customers pay** only for the **resources actually used**.

### Shift Toward Managed Services

* Cloud computing has moved toward **managed infrastructure and services**.
* Benefits:

  * Less time and money spent on infrastructure maintenance.
  * Faster and more reliable delivery of products and services.

### Serverless Computing

* Removes need for server configuration and infrastructure management.
* Developers focus **only on code**.
* Google’s serverless technologies:

  * **Cloud Run** – Deploys containerized microservices in a fully managed environment.
  * **Cloud Functions** – Manages event-driven code with **pay-as-you-go** pricing.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

* Applications run in the **cloud**, not installed locally.
* Consumed directly over the internet by end users.
* Examples: **Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive** (Google Workspace).

## Google Cloud Offerings and Infrastructure

### Three Layers of Google Cloud

1. **Networking and Security** – Foundation for all Google infrastructure and applications.

* Billing accounts are charged automatically and invoiced monthly or at threshold limits.
* **Sub accounts** can separate billing by project, often used by resellers for their clients.

### Cost Management Tools

1. **Budgets**

   * Defined at billing account or project level.
   * Can be a fixed limit or tied to metrics (e.g., % of previous month’s spend).

2. **Alerts**

   * Notify users when expenses approach budget limits.
   * Common thresholds: **50%, 90%, 100%** (customizable).
   * Example: \$20,000 budget with a 90% alert → notification at \$18,000.

3. **Reports**

   * Visual tool in the console.
   * Monitors expenditure by project or service.

4. **Quotas**

   * Prevent over-consumption due to errors or malicious attacks.
   * Applied at the project level.
   * **Types of Quotas**:

     * **Rate Quotas**: Reset after a specific time (e.g., GKE → 1,000 API calls every 100 seconds).
     * **Allocation Quotas**: Limit on number of resources (e.g., 5 VPC networks per project by default).
   * Some quotas can be increased via Google Cloud Support.
