## Cloud Computing Overview

### Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Define **Cloud Computing**
- Explain the **5 Essential Characteristics** of Cloud Computing
- Describe the **4 Cloud Deployment Models**
- Describe the **3 Cloud Service Models**

---

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of computing resources—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software—**over the internet** with **pay-per-use pricing**.

#### NIST Definition:
> "Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources... that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."

---

### Five Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1. **On-Demand Self-Service**  
   Users can provision computing resources automatically without human interaction with the provider.

2. **Broad Network Access**  
   Services are available over the network and accessed through standard platforms (mobile, tablets, laptops, etc.).

3. **Resource Pooling**  
   Resources are pooled to serve multiple customers using a **multi-tenant model**. Physical resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned.

4. **Rapid Elasticity**  
   Capabilities can be elastically scaled up or down according to demand. To the user, resources may appear unlimited.

5. **Measured Service**  
   Usage is automatically monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both provider and consumer.

### Four Deployment Models
| Model         | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public**    | Resources are available over the internet and shared across organizations. |
| **Private**   | Resources are used exclusively by one organization, either on-premises or hosted. |
| **Hybrid**    | Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared. |
| **Community** | Shared by several organizations with common concerns (e.g., compliance, mission). |

---

### Three Service Models
| Model         | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IaaS**      | *Infrastructure as a Service* - Provides basic computing infrastructure like servers, storage, and networks. Example: AWS EC2 |
| **PaaS**      | *Platform as a Service* - Offers platforms for developers to build and deploy apps. Example: Google App Engine |
| **SaaS**      | *Software as a Service* - Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Example: Microsoft 365 |

---

### Summary
- Cloud computing enables flexible, cost-efficient access to computing resources.
- It is defined by five essential characteristics: **self-service, broad access, resource pooling, elasticity,** and **measured usage**.
- It can be deployed through **public, private, hybrid,** or **community** models.
- Services are delivered through **IaaS, PaaS,** and **SaaS** models, catering to different layers of the technology stack.
