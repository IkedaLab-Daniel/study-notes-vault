# Google Cloud Computing Foundations Certificate

>> Course 1: Google Cloud Computing Foundations: Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## Google Cloud Computing Foundations Course

### Course Overview

* Designed for beginners with little to no background in cloud computing.
* Covers **cloud computing, big data, and machine learning** concepts.
* Explains how Google Cloud fits into these areas.
* Consists of **10 modules**, **25 hands-on labs**, and **4 final challenge labs** (about 24 hours of experiential learning).
* Opportunity to earn **4 Google Cloud skill badges**.

### Course Modules

1. **So, what's the cloud anyway?** – Introduction to cloud concepts and business impact.
2. **Start with a solid platform** – Different ways to interact with Google Cloud.
3. **Use Google Cloud to Build your Apps** – Building apps with Google Cloud resources and serverless services.
4. **Where do I store this stuff?** – Structured and unstructured storage models.
5. **There's an API for that!** – Application-managed service options in the cloud.
6. **You can't secure the cloud, right?** – Security in Google Cloud.
7. **It helps to network** – Building secure networks in the cloud.
8. **Keeping an eye on things** – Tools for cloud automation and management.
9. **You have the data, but what are you doing with it?** – Managed big data services in the cloud.
10. **Let machines do the work** – Introduction to machine learning.

### Hands-On Labs

* Hosted on **Google Cloud Skills Boost** (real environments, not simulations).
* Accessible through a standard web browser with temporary credentials provided.
* Includes instructions, live scenarios, and free credits for lab use.
* Labs must be **started and ended properly** (using Start Lab and End Lab buttons).

### Skill Badges Earned

By completing labs and challenge labs, learners can earn the following badges:

* **Implement Load Balancing on Compute Engine**
* **Set Up an App Dev Environment on Google Cloud**
* **Build a Secure Google Cloud Network**
* **Prepare Data for ML APIs on Google Cloud**

Each badge involves hands-on labs leading to a **final Challenge Lab** as a capstone.

## Module 1: So, What's the Cloud Anyway?

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Identify what cloud computing is and its impact on technology and business.
* Explore the concept of **cloud computing**.
* Compare and contrast **physical, virtual, and cloud architectures**.
* Differentiate between **IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS**.
* Get introduced to **Google Cloud compute, storage, big data, and ML services**.
* Examine the **Google network** and how it powers cloud computing.

### Module Flow

1. Definition of **cloud computing**.
2. Comparison of **cloud vs. traditional architecture**.
3. Exploration of **IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS** models.
4. Overview of **Google Cloud architecture**.
5. **Quiz and recap** of the topics covered.

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

### Definition

Cloud computing, as defined by the **US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, is a model of using IT resources that has **five key traits**:

1. **On-demand and self-service** – Users can provision computing resources (processing, storage, network) through a web interface without human intervention.
2. **Accessible over the internet** – Resources can be accessed from anywhere with a connection.
3. **Resource pooling** – Providers maintain a large pool of resources, allocate them to users as needed, and achieve cost efficiency through bulk purchasing.
4. **Elasticity** – Resources can scale up or down quickly depending on demand.
5. **Pay-as-you-go** – Customers only pay for what they use or reserve; charges stop when usage stops.

### Infrastructure Analogy

* **Infrastructure** = underlying framework of facilities and systems.
* Example: A **city's infrastructure** includes transportation, power, water, and communication.
* In IT, infrastructure includes the services and systems that support applications and users.

### Google Cloud Focus

* The course will cover **Google Cloud infrastructure services**.
* Learners will gain familiarity with what these services do and how to begin using them.
