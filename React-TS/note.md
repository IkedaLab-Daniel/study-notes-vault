# React and TypeScript v2

## React and TypeScript Course Introduction

* **Instructor:** Steve, frontend engineering lead at **Temporal**, Denver, Colorado, originally from **New York/New Jersey**.
* **Team Focus:** Developer Tools — UI, VS Code plugins, and frontend engineering.
* **Course Focus:** Learning **TypeScript in React**, not just TypeScript alone.
* **Assumed Knowledge:** Familiar with React basics; no need to be a TypeScript expert.

### Key Themes

* **Philosophy & Practice:** Understand *why* and *how* TypeScript works with React.
* **Editor-Driven Learning:** Use **VS Code IntelliSense** to explore, hover, and learn directly in the editor.
* **Positive Feedback Loop:** Learn TypeScript by *building React components*.

### Learning Journey

* Begin with simple examples → progress to advanced TypeScript & React patterns.
* Explore conversion from **PropTypes** to **TypeScript types**.
* Use TypeScript to catch errors early instead of relying on console debugging.
* Appreciate **autocomplete** and **type safety** for preventing typos (e.g., Redux action types).

### Real-World Benefits

* Faster debugging and fewer runtime errors.
* Improved collaboration on large codebases with **instant compile-time feedback**.
* Encourages **simpler, clearer code** — less “magic,” more maintainability.

### Additional Notes

* **Setup:** Course repo and sandboxes provided for hands-on learning.
* **React 18 Updates:** Adjustments from React 17 (e.g., `React.FunctionComponent` no longer assumes `children`).
* **TypeScript Evolution:** Each version simplifies setup and boosts developer experience.
* **Final Advice:** Leverage your editor — modern TypeScript and React development thrives on *in-editor guidance*.
