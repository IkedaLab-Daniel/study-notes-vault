# Module 7: Manage your work with GitHub Projects

## Unit 1: Introduction
We know your work is dynamic. Priorities can change quickly and needing to stay current and aware of everything is how you and your team can be successful.

Luckily, GitHub Projects can help you stay organized, connected, and up-to-date in order to keep your team on track.

Projects connect your planning directly to the work your team is doing and flexibly adapts to whatever your team needs at any point. Project tables are built like a spreadsheet and give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use Project tables, Project boards, and custom fields to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.

Learning objectives:
- Discern the differences between Projects and Projects (Classic)
- Learn how to build an organization level Project
- Understand how to organize your Project
- Gain insight on how to edit the visibility, access, and management of your Project
- Know how to develop automation and insights from your Project

## Unit 3: How to create a project
Imagine you want to organize your team's feature backlog. Projects, GitHub's built-in program-management tool, is a perfect way to organize and prioritize your team's work in a single space.

### Creating an organization-level Project
First, you want to lay the foundation by creating a new Project. Creating is relatively quick and simple.

1. In the top right corner of GitHub.com, select your profile photo, then select Your organizations.
2. Scroll down to select the organization for your new Project.
3. Navigate from the Overview tab to the Projects tab.
4. Select the green button labeled New Project.
5. A pop-up prompts you to select either a template or start from scratch. Let's choose the Start from scratch option and select Table.
6. Select the green Create project button.

You just created a Project!

You can also create a personal Project by selecting your profile photo and navigating to Your projects. Once you're on your Projects page, select the green button titled New project.

### Set your Project's name, description, and README
Let's define your Project in a couple of different ways so that your team can easily understand what you're tracking.

1. Navigate to your newly created Project to edit your Project's name, description, and README.
2. At the top right of the page, select the three dots to open the menu and select Settings.
3. Project Name is where you edit the name of the Project.
4. Short description allows you to add a few words about the Project.
5. README lets you add information for your team to understand why you created this Project and what you hope to accomplish with it. Once finished, select Save changes.

### Add issues and pull requests to your Project
Adding issues and pull requests to your Project is what makes the tool so powerful. Projects enable you to know the status of tasks your team is working on to coordinate and complete your goals.

#### Add an existing issue and pull request
1. Copy the url of an existing issue or pull request.
2. Place your cursor in the bottom row of the Project next to the + and paste the URL of your issue or pull request.
3. Press Enter and your issue or pull request appears as a task in your Project.

#### Search for an existing issue and pull request
You can search for existing issues or pull requests by adding a new item.

1. Enter # to search repositories. You can type part of the repository name to narrow down your options.
2. Select the repository where the pull request or issue is located, which prompts to search issues and pull requests.
3. Start typing the title of the issue or pull request to find the one you want.
4. Select the issue or pull request.

#### Bulk add issues and pull requests
You can bulk add issues and pull requests to an existing repository to save time. It allows you to start organizing your team faster.
1. Select + in the bottom row of the Project.
2. Select Add item from repository.
3. To change the repository, select the dropdown and choose a repository. The issues and pull requests then populate.
4. You can either select all or select those issues or pull requests you want to include.
5. Once you're ready to add the issues and pull requests to your Project, select the green button titled Add selected items in the bottom right corner.
