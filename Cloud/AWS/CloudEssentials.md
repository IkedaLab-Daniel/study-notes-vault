* **Course Goals**

  * Explain AWS Cloud fundamentals with analogies, examples, and demos.
  * Keep concepts simple and practical.
  * Show real-world AWS service use cases.

* **AWS Overview**

  * AWS is the world’s most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform.
  * Offers services in compute, databases, storage, AI, content delivery, and more.
  * Millions of customers use AWS for agility, cost savings, and faster innovation.

* **Client-Server Model (Coffee Shop Analogy)**

  * *Client*: Customer making a request (Alan).
  * *Server*: Barista fulfilling the request (Morgan).
  * Request → validation → response (e.g., order coffee = get coffee).
  * Represents how cloud servers handle requests and deliver results.

* **Complexity of Applications**

  * Real business solutions often involve multiple servers and components.
  * The course will build from basic to more complex cloud concepts.

* **AWS Key Concept: Pay Only for What You Use**

  * Compared to staffing a coffee shop: employees (resources) are only paid for hours worked.
  * On-premises data centers = over-provisioning, wasted costs.
  * AWS = provision resources on demand, scale up/down instantly.
  * Stop paying immediately once resources are deprovisioned.

* **Takeaway**

  * First AWS concept learned: **pay-as-you-go model**.
  * AWS enables flexible, cost-efficient, and scalable IT operations.
  * This foundation will support deeper exploration of cloud concepts throughout the course.
