# Intermediate React, v6
[Course Link](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-v6/)

## Course Context

* Continuation of Complete Intro to React v9, but v5 or older not required.
* Focused on newer React concepts: React Server Components, performance, transitions.
* v5 still valid for Redux/TypeScript.
* Designed as a companion to Intro to React v9.

## Course Structure

### Part 1: React Server & Rendering

* Review client-side React, static site generation, server-side rendering.
* React Server Components (RSCs): without framework and with Next.js.

### Part 2: Performance

* Make apps performant (actual) and feel performant (perceived).

## Audience

* Not for first-time coders or first JavaScript learners.
* Good for those with React fundamentals or Intro to React v9.
* Some Node.js exposure helpful since RSCs need it.

## Teaching Style & Resources

* First half: build from scratch.
* Second half: starter repos provided.
* Completed repos available for comparison.
* Starter repos are minimal boilerplate, completed repos are full examples.

## Setup & Tools

* **Node.js**: Requires Node ‚â•20.16 (using v22.14 LTS).
* **Node version managers**: Fast Node Manager (preferred), NVM, or Volta.

  * Bun: \~65% chance course works (not tested).
  * Deno: \~50% chance it won‚Äôt work.
* **Editor**: VS Code (primary), occasionally Copilot and Cursor.
* **AI completions**: Disabled during course for focus.

## AI Disclaimer

* All course text/code written by Brian Holt.
* AI (Claude) only used for:

  * Generating sample data (SQLite).
  * SEO content (summaries/keywords).
* Stance: AI is powerful if you understand the code and review it like an intern‚Äôs work; risky if relied on without depth.

## React 19 Notes

* React 19 recently released after long testing (used internally by Facebook for \~2 years).
* Stable despite being ‚Äúnew.‚Äù
* Major feature: React Server Components (RSCs).
* Other new features (like React Compiler) covered in **Complete Intro to React v9**, not this course.
* Course focuses primarily on RSCs and their practical use.

## Render Modes & Server Components

* **Render modes**: Four different ways to write React (not official terms, Brian‚Äôs own). They can be mixed, not mutually exclusive.
* **Client-Side React (CSR)**:

  * Traditional SPA approach (10+ years old, still widely used).
  * Ships HTML + JS bundle, browser handles rendering.
  * Server only sends `index.html`.
  * Default starting point for most projects.
* **Server-side features (SSR, SSG, RSCs)**:

  * Optional, not always a win.
  * Should solve a real problem (performance, SEO, etc.).
  * Adds complexity‚Äîmeasure if it‚Äôs worth it.
* **Static Site Generation (SSG)**:

  * Pre-renders content to static HTML.
  * Great for marketing/tutorial sites, mostly text/images, minimal interactivity.
  * Example: This course site uses Next.js SSG and is hosted free on GitHub Pages.
  * Markdown ‚Üí HTML pages workflow.
* **Next.js**:

  * Excellent for hybrid approaches.
  * SSG, SSR, and RSC support out of the box.
  * Brian uses it extensively (Neon, other companies).
* **Setup demo**:

  * `mkdir SSG && cd SSG`
  * `npm init -y`
  * `npm install react@19 react-dom@19`
  * Use **ES modules** (`"type": "module"`) in `package.json`.
  * Skip JSX/Babel to stay simple (focus is Node, not React syntax).
  * Create `index.html` with a `div#root` and special comment placeholder for React render.

## Static Site Generation with React (No JSX)

* **App.js setup**

  * Import `createElement` as `h` (old convention, avoids JSX).
  * Define `App` function returning elements:

    * `div` ‚Üí `h1` (‚ÄúHello Frontend Masters‚Äù) + `p` (‚ÄúThis is SSG‚Äù).
  * `export default App`.
  * Simpler than JSX‚Äîno Babel/Vite/Webpack needed.

* **Build.js process**

  * Import `renderToStaticMarkup` from `react-dom/server`.
  * Import `h` (createElement) + `App`.
  * Import Node modules: `fs`, `path`, `url` helpers.
  * Handle `__dirname` workaround for ES modules (`fileURLToPath`).
  * Read `index.html` shell file.
  * Render `App` ‚Üí string with `renderToStaticMarkup`.
  * Replace placeholder in `index.html` with rendered string.
  * Ensure `dist/` exists:

    * If not ‚Üí create it.
    * If yes ‚Üí empty it, then write new `index.html`.

* **Result**

  * Running `node build` generates static HTML in `dist/`.
  * No React reference in output‚Äîjust plain HTML.
  * This is the essence of **Static Site Generation (SSG)**.

* **Takeaways**

  * Frameworks like Next.js, Astro, Gatsby automate this process.
  * Custom code shows the *first principles* of SSG.
  * Great for content-driven sites (docs, tutorials, marketing).
  * Can still add React interactivity on top (SPA feel, routers).
  * Markdown ‚Üí HTML ‚Üí React components possible (e.g., **MDX**).

* **State of the art**:

  * **Next.js** + **Astro** are leading tools today.
  * Gatsby less maintained after Netlify acquisition.

## üîë What SSR Does

* Normally (CSR ‚Äì client-side rendering):

  * Browser requests ‚Üí server returns empty `index.html` + React bundle.
  * Browser parses + executes React JS ‚Üí only then app appears & becomes interactive.
  * **Time to first paint = Time to interactive**.

* With **SSR**:

  * Server pre-renders the React component tree ‚Üí sends HTML markup.
  * Browser shows HTML immediately (fast **first paint**).
  * Then React JS bundle arrives, hydrates, and makes it interactive.
  * **Perceived performance improves** ‚Üí users see something sooner.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Tradeoffs

* **Pros**

  * Faster perceived load, especially on **slow devices or bad networks**.
  * Useful for rural areas, low-end Android, poor connectivity (e.g., crop trackers, gov apps).
  * SEO benefits (search engines can crawl content directly).

* **Cons**

  * **Slower ‚Äútime to interactive‚Äù** (hydration takes time).
  * **Complexity**:

    * Must handle server + client rendering differences.
    * Browser-only APIs (`window`, `document`, `localStorage`, analytics, etc.) can crash if used during SSR.
  * **Server load**: rendering on the server consumes CPU.
  * Sometimes **worse performance** (e.g., Netflix found SSR harmed certain regions).

## üìä When to Use

* Don‚Äôt assume SSR is always a win ‚Üí **measure it**.

* Tools:

  * **Lighthouse** (first meaningful paint, time to interactive).
  * **Chrome DevTools performance tab**.
  * **Google Analytics** (real user timings).
  * Server instrumentation (Fastify/Express plugins for response timings).

* If your audience:

  * **Fast devices + fast network** ‚Üí SSR may be useless/slower.
  * **Slow devices + bad networks** ‚Üí SSR can be a huge UX win.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

* Typical stack: React + Node server (Fastify, Express, etc.).
* Server sends **pre-rendered HTML** + JS bundle.
* React hydrates ‚Üí attaches event listeners, enables interactivity.
* Real-world frameworks (Next.js, Remix, Astro) automate this.

üëâ **Bottom line**:
SSR ‚â† universally better. It‚Äôs a **tradeoff between complexity and user experience**. Always measure with real-world conditions before committing.
