Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines
that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be
applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning
and problem-solving.

AI is used in various fields including healthcare, finance, education, and transportation.
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience
without being explicitly programmed.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with many layers to analyze
different factors of data. AI systems can be reactive, limited memory, theory of mind, or
self-aware.
