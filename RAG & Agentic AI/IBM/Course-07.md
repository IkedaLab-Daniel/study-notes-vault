# Agentic AI with LangChain and LangGraph

> # Module 1: Introduction to LangGraph
## Course Overview: Agentic AI Development with LangChain & LangGraph

* The field is shifting from **passive AI** (responds to prompts) to **Agentic AI** — systems that can **reason, plan, and act autonomously**.
* Businesses are rapidly adopting Agentic AI to handle **complex, multi-step workflows**, driving strong demand for developers skilled in **LangChain** and **LangGraph**.

### What Agentic AI Enables

Agentic systems excel at:

* Autonomy and decision-making
* Tool integration
* Multi-step reasoning

Key application areas include:

* Autonomous customer support
* Financial and market analysis
* Healthcare and diagnostics
* Supply chain and logistics
* Legal and compliance
* E-commerce and retail
* Government and defense

### Who This Course Is For

Designed for:

* Software engineers
* Data scientists
* ML engineers
* AI architects
* Automation engineers

**Requirements:**

* Strong Python skills (you’ll build agents immediately)
* Familiarity with core AI concepts
* Prior exposure to LangChain is recommended

### What You’ll Learn

#### Foundations

* What Agentic AI is and how it differs from traditional generative AI
* Core components and architecture of **LangGraph**
* **LangGraph vs LangChain** — when and why to use each

#### LangGraph Basics

* LangGraph 101
* Build your first **stateful AI workflow**
* Learn graph-based agent design fundamentals through hands-on labs

#### Agent Architectures

You’ll explore three powerful agent patterns:

* **Reflection Agents**
* **Reflexion Agents**
* **ReAct Agents**

You’ll learn how to:

* Integrate external knowledge
* Reason before acting
* Build practical agents (including a **LinkedIn post optimization agent**)

#### From Single-Agent to Multi-Agent Systems

* Understand how agents **collaborate, communicate, and coordinate**
* Explore **Agentic RAG** as a foundation for multi-agent interactions

### How to Succeed in the Course

* Watch all videos
* Complete readings and labs
* Use cheat sheets
* Take practice quizzes
* Finish the graded assessment

This course prepares you to design **autonomous, self-improving, multi-agent systems** and build real-world Agentic AI applications using LangChain and LangGraph.
