## API Design with Node.js V4 
- FrontendMasters | Scott Moss

* Course focuses on **designing APIs in Node.js** with updated tools and techniques.
* No need to have taken V3, though it covers different things.
* Topics covered:

  * Overview of course goals, tools, and what you’ll build.
  * Basics of building a **vanilla Node.js API** (no framework).
  * Anatomy of an API and its components.
  * Using **Express** to simplify API development.
  * Using **Prisma** to interact with databases.
  * **Data modeling**: schema design from real-world ideas.
  * **Routes and middleware**: designing interaction patterns.
  * **Authentication, authorization, identification** explained and implemented.
  * **Route handlers**: core logic connecting clients to the database.
  * **Error handling** to keep APIs stable and resilient.
  * **Configuration with environment variables** for flexibility.
  * **Performance techniques** to keep APIs fast in Node.js.
  * **Testing** to ensure functionality and reliability.
  * **Deployment** so APIs can be used and connected to apps.

## Tools Used in API Design with Node.js V4

* **Runtime**:

  * **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime outside the browser.
  * Chosen because: familiar for frontend devs, large ecosystem, widely used.

* **Framework**:

  * **Express.js** – most popular Node.js framework for APIs.
  * Large community, foundational for many other frameworks, and instructor’s preferred choice.

* **Database**:

  * **Postgres** – replacing MongoDB used in earlier versions.
  * Instructor has recent experience with it, widely adopted, strong SQL ecosystem, good career skill.

* **Hosting**:

  * **Render.com** – modern platform with simple Node.js deployment, similar to early Heroku experience.
  * Will discuss alternatives but focus is on Render.

* **Project**:

  * Building a **changelog app** where users can post product updates/features.

* **Language/Modules**:

  * Start with **CommonJS (require)**, then switch to **ES6 modules (import/export)**.
  * **TypeScript** will be added later for typing and better structure.
