# Intermediate React, v6
[Course Link](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-v6/)

## Course Context

* Continuation of Complete Intro to React v9, but v5 or older not required.
* Focused on newer React concepts: React Server Components, performance, transitions.
* v5 still valid for Redux/TypeScript.
* Designed as a companion to Intro to React v9.

## Course Structure

### Part 1: React Server & Rendering

* Review client-side React, static site generation, server-side rendering.
* React Server Components (RSCs): without framework and with Next.js.

### Part 2: Performance

* Make apps performant (actual) and feel performant (perceived).

## Audience

* Not for first-time coders or first JavaScript learners.
* Good for those with React fundamentals or Intro to React v9.
* Some Node.js exposure helpful since RSCs need it.

## Teaching Style & Resources

## React 19 Notes

* React 19 recently released after long testing (used internally by Facebook for \~2 years).
* Stable despite being ‚Äúnew.‚Äù
* Major feature: React Server Components (RSCs).
* Other new features (like React Compiler) covered in **Complete Intro to React v9**, not this course.
* Course focuses primarily on RSCs and their practical use.

## Render Modes & Server Components

* **Render modes**: Four different ways to write React (not official terms, Brian‚Äôs own). They can be mixed, not mutually exclusive.
* **Client-Side React (CSR)**:

  * Traditional SPA approach (10+ years old, still widely used).
  * Ships HTML + JS bundle, browser handles rendering.
  * Server only sends `index.html`.
  * Default starting point for most projects.
* **Server-side features (SSR, SSG, RSCs)**:

  * Optional, not always a win.
  * Should solve a real problem (performance, SEO, etc.).
  * Adds complexity‚Äîmeasure if it‚Äôs worth it.
* **Static Site Generation (SSG)**:

  * Pre-renders content to static HTML.
  * Great for marketing/tutorial sites, mostly text/images, minimal interactivity.
  * Example: This course site uses Next.js SSG and is hosted free on GitHub Pages.
  * Markdown ‚Üí HTML pages workflow.
* **Next.js**:

  * Excellent for hybrid approaches.
  * SSG, SSR, and RSC support out of the box.
  * Brian uses it extensively (Neon, other companies).
* **Setup demo**:

  * `mkdir SSG && cd SSG`
  * `npm init -y`
  * `npm install react@19 react-dom@19`
  * Use **ES modules** (`"type": "module"`) in `package.json`.
  * Skip JSX/Babel to stay simple (focus is Node, not React syntax).
  * Create `index.html` with a `div#root` and special comment placeholder for React render.

## Static Site Generation with React (No JSX)

* **App.js setup**

  * Import `createElement` as `h` (old convention, avoids JSX).
  * Define `App` function returning elements:

    * `div` ‚Üí `h1` (‚ÄúHello Frontend Masters‚Äù) + `p` (‚ÄúThis is SSG‚Äù).
  * `export default App`.
  * Simpler than JSX‚Äîno Babel/Vite/Webpack needed.

* **Build.js process**

  * Import `renderToStaticMarkup` from `react-dom/server`.
  * Import `h` (createElement) + `App`.
  * Import Node modules: `fs`, `path`, `url` helpers.
  * Handle `__dirname` workaround for ES modules (`fileURLToPath`).
  * Read `index.html` shell file.
  * Render `App` ‚Üí string with `renderToStaticMarkup`.
  * Replace placeholder in `index.html` with rendered string.
  * Ensure `dist/` exists:

    * If not ‚Üí create it.
    * If yes ‚Üí empty it, then write new `index.html`.

* **Result**

  * Running `node build` generates static HTML in `dist/`.
  * No React reference in output‚Äîjust plain HTML.
  * This is the essence of **Static Site Generation (SSG)**.

* **Takeaways**

  * Frameworks like Next.js, Astro, Gatsby automate this process.
  * Custom code shows the *first principles* of SSG.
  * Great for content-driven sites (docs, tutorials, marketing).
  * Can still add React interactivity on top (SPA feel, routers).
  * Markdown ‚Üí HTML ‚Üí React components possible (e.g., **MDX**).

* **State of the art**:

  * **Next.js** + **Astro** are leading tools today.
  * Gatsby less maintained after Netlify acquisition.

## üîë What SSR Does

* Normally (CSR ‚Äì client-side rendering):

  * Browser requests ‚Üí server returns empty `index.html` + React bundle.
  * Browser parses + executes React JS ‚Üí only then app appears & becomes interactive.
  * **Time to first paint = Time to interactive**.

* With **SSR**:

  * Server pre-renders the React component tree ‚Üí sends HTML markup.
  * Browser shows HTML immediately (fast **first paint**).
  * Then React JS bundle arrives, hydrates, and makes it interactive.
  * **Perceived performance improves** ‚Üí users see something sooner.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Tradeoffs

* **Pros**

  * Faster perceived load, especially on **slow devices or bad networks**.
  * Useful for rural areas, low-end Android, poor connectivity (e.g., crop trackers, gov apps).
  * SEO benefits (search engines can crawl content directly).

* **Cons**

  * **Slower ‚Äútime to interactive‚Äù** (hydration takes time).
  * **Complexity**:

    * Must handle server + client rendering differences.
    * Browser-only APIs (`window`, `document`, `localStorage`, analytics, etc.) can crash if used during SSR.
  * **Server load**: rendering on the server consumes CPU.
  * Sometimes **worse performance** (e.g., Netflix found SSR harmed certain regions).

---

## üìä When to Use

* Don‚Äôt assume SSR is always a win ‚Üí **measure it**.

* Tools:

  * **Lighthouse** (first meaningful paint, time to interactive).
  * **Chrome DevTools performance tab**.
  * **Google Analytics** (real user timings).
  * Server instrumentation (Fastify/Express plugins for response timings).

* If your audience:

  * **Fast devices + fast network** ‚Üí SSR may be useless/slower.
  * **Slow devices + bad networks** ‚Üí SSR can be a huge UX win.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

* Typical stack: React + Node server (Fastify, Express, etc.).
* Server sends **pre-rendered HTML** + JS bundle.
* React hydrates ‚Üí attaches event listeners, enables interactivity.
* Real-world frameworks (Next.js, Remix, Astro) automate this.

---

üëâ **Bottom line**:
SSR ‚â† universally better. It‚Äôs a **tradeoff between complexity and user experience**. Always measure with real-world conditions before committing.

## Writing SSR by Hand

* Created a new directory `SSR` and initialized it with `npm init -y`.
* Installed dependencies: `fastify`, `react`, `react-dom`, and `vite`.
* Recommended locking versions by copying his `package.json` to avoid version drift issues.
* Added scripts in `package.json`:

  * `build`: runs `vite build`.
  * `start`: runs `node server.js`.
  * Also included `"type": "module"`.
* Built a simple `index.html` with a `div#root` as the mount point.
* Warned that **SSR + client hydration is highly sensitive to whitespace**, which can cause hydration errors.
* Explained hydration: server generates markup ‚Üí client re-checks with a hash ‚Üí mismatch causes React to discard SSR and re-render, losing SSR benefits.
* Created `app.js` without JSX (using `React.createElement` syntax):

  * Defined a simple `App` component with `useState` to show interactivity.
  * Rendered `h1`, `p`, and a `button` that increments a counter.
* Highlighted how tedious non-JSX code is, making JSX more appreciated.

## Client and Server Setup for SSR

* **Client Setup (`client.js`)**

  * Created `client.js` to handle hydration on the browser.
  * Used `hydrateRoot` instead of `createRoot` to attach React to existing server-rendered markup.
  * Imported `createElement` and the `App` component.
  * Called `hydrateRoot(document.getElementById("root"), h(App))`.
  * Safe place to add browser-only logic (e.g., Google Analytics), since this code never runs on the server.

* **Server Setup (`server.js`)**

  * Imported dependencies: `fastify`, `fastify-static`, `fs`, `path`, `fileURLToPath`, `renderToString`, and `App`.
  * Used `renderToString` (not `renderToStaticMarkup`) to include React metadata for hydration.
  * Read `dist/index.html` as a shell and split it at the `ROOT` placeholder.
  * On `GET /`:

    * Flushed the **head part** (`parts[0]`) first so the browser can start downloading CSS/JS while React renders.
    * Rendered the app with `renderToString(h(App))` and streamed it.
    * Flushed the closing part (`parts[1]`) and ended the response.
  * Registered `fastify-static` to serve built files.
  * Added a `<script type="module" async defer src="./client.js">` in `index.html` to load the client bundle.

* **Build & Run**

  * Needed `vite build` so that the correct hashed script files exist in `dist/`.
  * Then started server with `npm run start`.
  * Verified SSR by checking **View Page Source**, which showed complete markup before React hydration.

* **Key Notes**

  * SSR improves perceived performance by sending usable markup immediately.
  * Hydration errors are often caused by **whitespace mismatches** between server and client render.
  * Frameworks usually handle this automatically, but writing SSR by hand highlights how sensitive it is.

## SSR Questions and Answers

* **Whitespace & Prettier Issues**

  * Hydration errors only matter in `index.html`.
  * Extra whitespace in `index.html` can break hydration because React compares hashes of server vs. client markup.
  * Whitespace in other files doesn‚Äôt matter.

* **Changing Counter Start Value**

  * Modify `App` component to set initial state (e.g., `useState(5)`).
  * Since no dev mode is running, changes require:

    1. `npm run build`
    2. Restarting the server

* **Splitting HTML for SSR**

  * `server.js` splits `index.html` at the root div.
  * First part (head + script tags) is sent immediately so browser begins downloading assets.
  * Async + defer attributes are critical so scripts don‚Äôt block rendering.
  * Then render React output in the root div.
  * Finally send closing HTML.
  * For multiple ‚Äúislands‚Äù (e.g., micro frontends), split at each root and inject corresponding markup.

* **Render to String vs. Pipeable Stream**

  * `renderToString`: waits until React finishes rendering, then sends one complete chunk.
  * `renderToPipeableStream`: streams chunks as React renders them (e.g., nav first, then body).
  * For small apps, both behave the same. Pipeable streams only help with complex apps needing progressive rendering.
  * If no complexity/size benefits, SSR may not be worth using.

## React Server Components (RSCs)

* **Definition & Difference from SSR**

  * SSR: does one initial render, then client-side React takes over.
  * RSCs: only render on the server, maintaining an ongoing relationship between client and server.
  * They are independent concepts‚Äîyou can use SSR, RSCs, both, or neither.

* **Key Properties**

  * Client never receives the server component‚Äôs code‚Äîonly markup (or React Flight protocol).
  * Enables writing database queries or using secrets directly inside React components safely.
  * Most of the app‚Äôs non-interactive parts can stay on the server, reducing hydration needs.
  * Client bundle shrinks since server components don‚Äôt ship to the browser.

* **Benefits & Trade-offs**

  * Less JavaScript downloaded, smaller client bundle.
  * Simplifies workflows (e.g., forms writing directly to DB without separate API endpoints).
  * Great for securely handling API keys/secrets.
  * Downsides: added cognitive load‚Äîdevelopers must track ‚Äúclient vs. server‚Äù components.
  * Cannot use client-only features (e.g., `useState`) inside RSCs.
  * Performance depends: fewer downloads but more server requests ‚Üí slow connections may suffer.

* **Framework Support**

  * Next.js: RSCs by default (must opt into client components).
  * TanStack Start: opposite‚Äîclient by default, opt into server components.
  * React Router v7 & Remix: partial/experimental support.
  * RSCs intended to be used through frameworks, not by hand (unstable APIs).

* **Developer Experience**

  * Shifts paradigm: blends server/client logic, making it feel closer to PHP-style rendering.
  * Allows creating secure, simplified client-server workflows without explicit API layers.
  * Still confusing and evolving‚Äîframeworks abstract much of the complexity.

* **Planned Example App**

  * Building a **NotePasser** app (like passing paper notes in class).
  * Simplified for teaching: no authentication (always user ID 1).
  * Auth can be added later with providers like Clerk, Descope, Neon Auth.

## Building RSCs Without a Framework

Brian Holt guided us through setting up React Server Components (RSCs) without using frameworks like Next.js. Instead, we became ‚Äúthe framework,‚Äù wiring everything ourselves.

* Started by creating a **new project** with a prepared `package.json` and running `npm install`.
* Used **CommonJS** instead of ES modules to simplify setup.
* Chose **Webpack** (instead of Vite/Parcel) because of the required package `react-server-dom-webpack`, which enables RSC support in Node.
* Added supporting tools: **Babel** (JSX transpiling), **Fastify** (server), **Pino** (logging), **SQLite3** (database), and loaders for **CSS**.
* Configured **webpack.config.js** with:

  * `HtmlWebpackPlugin` to generate the HTML shell.
  * `ReactServerWebpackPlugin` to handle RSC stubs and server actions.
  * Rules for Babel (`.js/.jsx`) and CSS.
  * Output, optimization, and resolve settings.
* Built **babel.config.js** to enable React JSX transform with `"automatic"` runtime.
* Created a minimal **index.html** referencing `index.css` and a `#root` div.
* Added a **notes.db** SQLite file and custom **index.css** inside `public/`.
* Defined scripts in `package.json`:

  * `dev:client` ‚Üí runs Webpack in watch mode.
  * `dev:server` ‚Üí runs Node with `--conditions react-server` to ensure proper RSC behavior.

## Creating App, Server, and Client Components

* Created a **`src/App.jsx`** file as the main entry point.

  * Imported `Suspense` from React.
  * Imported `ServerComponent` and `ClientComponent`.
  * Logged render behavior for debugging.
  * Returned a `Suspense` boundary with fallback `"loading"`, plus a header, server component, and client component.
  * By default, components are **server components** unless explicitly marked as client.

* Defined rules:

  * **Server components** ‚Üí run on the server, cannot use React hooks.
  * **Client components** ‚Üí required for interactivity and hooks.
  * Server components can contain client components, but not the reverse.

* Built a **client component** (`ClientComponent.jsx`):

  * Added `"use client"` directive at the top.
  * Used `useState` to implement a counter.
  * Returned UI with a counter value and increment button.
  * Confirmed normal React interactivity works in client components.

## Building the Server Component and Client Bootstrap

* **ServerComponent.jsx**

  * Default to server component (no `"use server"` needed).
  * Can use Node APIs (`path`, `sqlite3`) directly.
  * Supports `async/await` in function bodies.
  * Example: `MyNotes` component queries a SQLite `notes.db` file for user notes.
  * Query joins `users` table twice (from\_user, to\_user) to display names instead of IDs.
  * Renders a `<table>` with `from`, `to`, and `note`.
  * Shows how SQL can be written inline within a React server component.
  * **Security note**: escape user-generated content before inserting into DB; React prevents XSS unless using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

* **Database/ORM compatibility**

  * Works with SQLite, Prisma, Drizzle, Neon, etc.
  * Treat server components like API routes‚Äîany database logic fits.

* **Client bootstrap (`client.jsx`)**

  * Imports `createRoot` (React DOM) and `createFromFetch` (`react-server-dom-webpack/client`).
  * Loads CSS (`doodle.css`).
  * Fetches markup from `/react-flight` endpoint.
  * `root.render(p)` can directly render the promise returned by `createFromFetch(fetchPromise)`.
  * Allows hydration of server-rendered components into client React tree.

  ## Setting Up the Server with Fastify and React Server Components

* **Main.js (patching requires)**

  * Uses `react-server-dom-webpack/node-register` to patch Node‚Äôs require for JSX + React server components.
  * Uses `@babel/register` with plugin `@babel/transform-modules-commonjs` to handle ES modules.
  * Ignores transpiling of `dist`, `server`, and `node_modules` via regex.
  * Runs `require("./server")()` after patching so subsequent requires are processed.
  * Separate file is necessary since patching must happen **before** other requires.

* **Server.js (Fastify server setup)**

  * Requires core modules: `path`, `fs`, `fastify`, `@fastify/static`, `react`, and `react-server-dom-webpack/server`.
  * Loads `App.jsx` as `AppImport.default` (CommonJS interop).
  * Reads **client manifest** (`dist/react-client-manifest.json`) ‚Üí used as module map for Webpack.
  * Configurable `PORT` via `process.env.PORT` (default 3000).
  * Sets up **Fastify** with `pino-pretty` logger for readable logs.
  * Registers `@fastify/static` twice:

    * Serves `dist` under `/assets`.
    * Serves `public` directly (for CSS, etc.).
  * Route `/` ‚Üí serves `index.html`.
  * Route `/react-flight` ‚Üí handler streams React server components using `renderToPipeableStream`.
  * Exports `server` function that starts Fastify and logs errors.
  * Exits with status code `1` on fatal error.

## React Flight Protocol and Streaming with Server Components

* **Manual Flight Protocol (for learning only)**

  * React Flight protocol is essentially **JSON + references** describing UI markup.
  * Uses IDs (`0:`, `$1`, `$L3`, etc.) to reference and reuse components.
  * Mimics `createElement` calls (e.g., `"$":"div"`, children arrays).
  * Not documented publicly, highly unstable‚Äînever written by hand in real apps.
  * Example showed raw JSON being interpreted into rendered components.

* **Running the Server with Flight Protocol**

  * Start with `npm run dev:client` to build the client bundle.
  * Then run `npm run dev:server` to serve the app with Flight protocol.
  * Client manifest generated by Webpack provides mapping for bundles and components.
  * Flight protocol responses are transformed by React into actual rendered UI.

* **Switch to Proper Implementation**

  * Removed manual string-based JSON.
  * Used `renderToPipeableStream` from `react-server-dom-webpack/server`.
  * Rendered `React.createElement(App)` with the **module map** from client manifest.
  * Streamed chunks directly with `pipe(reply.raw)` for efficient, incremental rendering.

* **Debugging & Fixes**

  * Adjusted relative paths (e.g., `../`) for correct imports.
  * Resolved missing tables and incorrect manifest file names.
  * Final setup showed:

    * Server component rendering data.
    * Client component handling interactivity.
    * Network tab displaying Flight protocol requests/responses.

  ## RSCs Without vs With Frameworks, and Moving into Next.js

* **Building RSCs Without Frameworks**

  * Possible to build React Server Components (RSCs) entirely from scratch.
  * Demonstrates the inner workings (SQLite backend + client interactivity).
  * Educational, but not practical‚Äîframeworks like Next.js make this far easier.

* **Frameworks in Practice**

  * Developers use the same core tools (Webpack, Parcel, Vite, Turbopack).
  * Webpack still widely used, even in large corporations.
  * Turbopack is the ‚Äúnew hotness‚Äù and is built into Next.js.
  * Other older tools exist (e.g., Browserify), but modern devs prefer Vite or Parcel.

* **Next.js Context**

  * Next.js is not just a teaching tool, but a production-ready React framework.
  * Built and maintained mainly by Vercel, with many React core contributors.
  * Strong collaboration between Vercel and Meta (Facebook) for React‚Äôs evolution.

* **Why Next.js Matters**

  * First widely adopted *full-stack React framework*.
  * Moves more work to the server with **RSC-first architecture**.
  * By default, components are server components‚Äîdevelopers must opt into client components.
  * Changes how React apps are written, offering power but also trade-offs.
  * Not every React app needs Next.js; standalone React or other tools (like TanStack Start) remain useful.

* **How Next.js Can Be Used**

  1. **Monolith mode**: Next controls backend, middleware, and frontend (like Rails).
  2. **Middle-end mode**: Next acts as a server that aggregates microservices (e.g., Netflix model), not calling databases directly but consolidating API/service responses.

## Server Components in Next.js with SQLite

* **File Setup**

  * Create `app/my/page.js`.
  * Next.js conventions: lowercase filenames, use `.js` instead of `.jsx`.
  * Case sensitivity issues vary across OS (Linux vs Windows).

* **Database Fetching**

  * Use `sqlite3` with async/await.
  * Define `fetchNotes` function to open `notes.db`.
  * Run two queries (`from` and `to`) in parallel using `Promise.all`.
  * Return both sets of notes.

* **Rendering Notes**

  * Inside `MyNotes`, call `await fetchNotes`.
  * Render notes from the user (‚Äúnotes from you‚Äù) and notes addressed to the user (‚Äúnotes to you‚Äù).
  * Example output includes messages like ‚ÄúWebpack config broke again‚Äù and ‚ÄúYour function names are longer than my patience.‚Äù

* **Why It‚Äôs Simpler in Next.js**

  * Very similar logic to raw RSCs but easier because Next handles boilerplate.
  * Still powered by the **Flight protocol**, just encoded/optimized in the background.
  * Developers focus on queries + markup, not the low-level wiring.

* **Key Insight**

  * Next.js makes React Server Components practical and less error-prone, while still leveraging the same underlying RSC/Flight concepts.

## Writing Notes with Next.js Form Actions

* **Setup**

  * Create `app/write/page.js`.
  * Import `AsyncDatabase` and `postNote` (to be written).
  * Define `getUsers` to query all users from `notes.db`.

* **Why It‚Äôs Nice**

  * Next.js lets you run DB queries directly inside React server components.
  * No need for a separate API endpoint or `fetch`; forms can call server functions directly.

* **Form Structure**

  * `<form action={postNote}>` wires the form directly to the server function.
  * Browser manages form state, no need for `useState`.
  * Fields:

    * **From**: `<select name="from_user">` with `users.map` for options.
    * **To**: `<select name="to_user">` (same approach).
    * **Note**: `<textarea name="note" />`.
    * **Submit**: `<button type="submit">`.

* **Key Concept**

  * **Form Actions in Next.js**: form submissions invoke server functions directly with form data.
  * Eliminates boilerplate of extracting values, building API routes, and handling `fetch`.

* **Example Flow**

  * User fills form ‚Üí submits ‚Üí Next.js runs `postNote` server function ‚Üí note saved to database.

## Writing Notes with Server Actions in Next.js

* **PostNote Function**

  * Create `postNote.js`.
  * Must include `"use server"` at the top ‚Üí ensures it only runs on the server.
  * Function takes `formData`, extracts values with `formData.get("from_user")`, `"to_user"`, `"note"`.
  * Validate inputs ‚Üí throw error if missing.
  * Save to SQLite DB with parameterized query (`db.run("INSERT INTO notes (from_user, to_user, note) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", [from, to, note])`).

* **Placement**

  * Can live inside `write/page.js` or as its own file.
  * External file requires `"use server"`; inside a server component it‚Äôs implicit.

* **Debugging**

  * In **dev mode**, Next.js forwards server errors to the browser (easier debugging).
  * In **production**, errors return as 500s; handle with error boundaries/logging.
  * Standard breakpoints/debugger tools still work.

* **Notes Visibility**

  * ‚ÄúMy Notes‚Äù page currently filters by `user_id = 1`.
  * Other users‚Äô notes may not appear unless query is adjusted.

* **Under the Hood**

  * Submitting a form with `action={postNote}` ‚Üí Next.js transparently wires data to the server.
  * Uses built-in protocol (Flight) to send form data; developers don‚Äôt need to manage fetch/API endpoints.

* **Limitations**

  * Offline-first apps don‚Äôt pair well with RSCs/server actions, since they depend on a server.
  * Would require complex service worker logic for offline handling.

## Mixing Server and Client Components in Next.js

* **Server vs Client Components**

  * Once you enter **client land**, all children are client components.
  * You can‚Äôt nest a server component under a client component.
  * Solution: keep server component as parent ‚Üí pass data down as props.

* **Example: Teacher Feed**

  * **Server Component (`teacher/page.js`)**

    * Imports `fetchNotes` (server function).
    * Loads `initialNotes` via `await fetchNotes()`.
    * Renders `TeacherClientPage` with `initialNotes` + `fetchNotes` passed as props.
  * **Server Function (`fetchNotes.js`)**

    * `"use server"` directive required.
    * Connects to SQLite (`AsyncDatabase.open("./notes.db")`).
    * Returns rows with JOINs to map `from_user` and `to_user`.
    * Optional pagination via `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`.

* **Client Component (`clientPage.js`)**

  * `"use client"` directive required.
  * Uses `useState` for `notes` (initialized with `initialNotes`).
  * Uses `useEffect` with `setInterval` to poll `fetchNotes` every 5s.
  * Appends new notes using spread or `.concat()`.
  * **Cleanup:** `clearInterval` in effect teardown to prevent leaks.
  * Renders teacher‚Äôs feed (`ul > li`) with sender, receiver, and note.

* **Polling Behavior**

  * Poll requests may show as `POST` (due to React Flight machinery).
  * Even if a 500 error appears, notes may still update (debug query/columns if broken).

* **Why `"use server"`?**

  * Without it, Next bundles imported server-only libraries (e.g., `sqlite3`) into client bundle.
  * `"use server"` tells Next to exclude it from client-side code.
  * Required for non-component server utilities (actions, functions).
  * Server components imply it automatically, but helper functions need explicit directive.

## Limitations of React Server Components and Workarounds

* **Key Limitation**

  * Server components **cannot** be children of client components.
  * This becomes frustrating when you want to use client state inside a server component (e.g., SQL queries based on client input).
  * In such cases, you must fall back to the **classic approach**:

    * Create an API route.
    * Call it from the client with the necessary parameters.
    * Return results like before RSC existed.

* **Half-Workaround (Children Pattern)**

  * You can pass a **server component as a child** into a client component.
  * Since server components render first (at build or request time), you can pre-render them and let the client component receive them as `children`.
  * This allows server-rendered markup to coexist within client components.

* **Example: WhoAmI Pattern**

  * **Server Component (`WhoAmI.js`)**

    * Fetches user info from database (`AsyncDatabase.open("./notes.db")`).
    * Returns JSX with user details (name + ID).
  * **Client Component (`clientPage.js`)**

    * Accepts `children` (server component) and `id`.
    * Renders the server child

## Key Takeaways on RSCs and Framework Use

* **When to Use Next.js / RSCs**

  * Great for apps where the **client frequently interacts with the server** (lots of API calls, form submissions, database writes).
  * Not ideal for **heavily client-side apps** (e.g., drawing tools like Excalidraw) where state and rendering live almost entirely in the browser.
  * In such cases, lighter setups like **Vite** or **TanStack Router** are better.

* **Rule of Thumb**

  * RSCs are **sometimes useful**.
  * They simplify client-server interaction but can add overhead when the app doesn‚Äôt need much server interaction.

* **Other Ecosystems with Similar Paradigms**

  * **Meteor** (JS, older but had seamless client-server data flow).
  * **Rails / Phoenix** (server-driven rendering concepts).
  * **Phoenix LiveView** (Elixir).
  * **Laravel Livewire** (PHP).
  * Similar ideas exist across backends, React just branded it as RSC.

* **Conclusion**

  * React + RSCs aren‚Äôt revolutionary but adapt **old server-driven paradigms** for React developers.
  * React‚Äôs **flexibility** allows it to work standalone or as the foundation of larger frameworks.

## React Performance Optimizations ‚Äì When and Why

* **Default React Speed**

  * React is **fast enough out of the box** for almost all apps, even on slower devices.
  * Netflix measured this a decade ago and confirmed React generally performs fine without hacks.
  * Most performance issues in React come from **artificially created scenarios**, not normal use.

* **Golden Rule**

  * ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not preemptively optimize.**
  * Only apply performance techniques when you **measure** and **confirm a real problem**.
  * Adding tools like `memo` everywhere usually causes more complexity than benefit.

* **How React Re-renders**

  * If state updates inside a component (e.g., `setCount` in **Profile**):

    * Only that **component tree** re-renders.
    * Sibling components outside the dirty tree (**Content**) do **not** re-render.
    * Child components (**ProfilePic**, **ProfileName**) will re-render by default.
  * This re-rendering is usually **cheap and fine** for most apps.

* **When Optimization is Needed**

  * If a **child component is very expensive** to re-render (e.g., heavy image processing, big charts).
  * In such cases, you can **prevent unnecessary re-renders** with tools like `React.memo`.

* **Key Idea**

  * React‚Äôs default rendering strategy favors **simplicity and correctness**.
  * Optimization is **contextual**: only necessary when expensive components re-render without actual change.

## Introducing Performance Bottlenecks in React (JANK Example)

* **Setup**

  * A starter project with **Vite, React, Markdown parser (marked)**.
  * Created a `MarkdownPreview.jsx` component to simulate expensive rendering.
  * Added a **JANK-DELAY** loop to tie up the thread and simulate costly operations.

* **Expensive Render Simulation**

  * Used `performance.now()` inside a `while` loop to block the thread for \~100ms.
  * Helps visualize how re-renders can cause lag (jank) in UI interactions.
  * Added a counter (`last render`) to show how often re-renders happen.

* **Dangerously Set Inner HTML**

  * Used `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render parsed markdown.
  * Normally unsafe (XSS risks), but acceptable for controlled markdown input.

* **App Setup (`App.jsx`)**

  * `useState` for **text**, **theme**, and **time**.
  * `useEffect` with `setInterval` to update clock.
  * UI includes:

    * Current time (updates every second).
    * Theme selector (changes markdown text color).
    * Textarea editor for markdown input.
    * `MarkdownPreview` to render parsed markdown.

* **Observed Behavior**

  * Every state change (time, theme, or text) re-renders the expensive markdown preview.
  * Causes typing lag and sluggish UI.
  * Even without JANK delay, re-rendering full markdown on every keystroke is inefficient.

* **Key Takeaway**

  * React handles re-renders efficiently, but **expensive operations inside child components** can still cause jank.
  * This sets the stage for optimizations using **`memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`** to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Optimizing Janky Renders with `memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`

* **Problem with Re-Renders**

  * Wrapping `MarkdownPreview` with `memo` prevents re-renders **only if props are equal**.
  * Passing new object/function props each render breaks equality (`{}` !== `{}`).
  * Example: Two empty objects or functions are not equal in memory, even if identical in value.

* **Fixing Object Props with `useMemo`**

  * `useMemo` ensures the **same object reference** is reused across renders.
  * Usage:

    ```js
    const options = useMemo(() => ({ text, theme }), [text, theme]);
    ```
  * React reuses the cached object unless `text` or `theme` changes.

* **Fixing Function Props with `useCallback`**

  * Functions also create new references each render.
  * `useCallback` memoizes a function so React treats it as the same between renders.
  * Example:

    ```js
    const render = useCallback(() => { ... }, []);
    ```
  * Empty dependency array ‚Üí function reference never changes.

* **Combined Effect**

  * `memo` prevents re-renders **if props don‚Äôt change**.
  * `useMemo` ensures object props remain the same reference until dependencies change.
  * `useCallback` ensures function props remain the same reference.
  * Together, they stop unnecessary re-renders and contain the ‚Äúblast zone‚Äù of expensive code.

* **Result**

  * Markdown preview still takes time due to the simulated 100ms delay,
    but now **only updates when `text` or `theme` changes**, not on every clock tick.
  * Other parts of the UI (like the live clock) stay smooth.

* **Key Takeaway**

  * Use `memo` + `useMemo` + `useCallback` to control re-renders.
  * Prevents props from breaking equality checks due to new object/function references.
  * Helps contain expensive operations without affecting unrelated components.

## `useMemo` vs `useCallback`, Memo Pitfalls, and React Compiler

* **`useMemo` vs `useCallback`**

  * `useCallback` is basically `useMemo(() => fn, deps)`.
  * Core devs regret adding `useCallback`; it exists mainly for readability.
  * Strings/numbers don‚Äôt need memoization (`x === x` by value).
  * Only objects/functions need `useMemo`/`useCallback` since equality is by reference.

* **Pitfalls of Overusing Memoization**

  * Can cause bugs when expected re-renders don‚Äôt happen.
  * Memoized parent blocks children from re-rendering, leading to confusing issues.
  * Use sparingly‚ÄîReact is usually fast enough without it.

* **Complex JSON Structures**

  * Idea: `JSON.stringify` as a memo key ‚Üí risky (not guaranteed deterministic).
  * Better: selectively memoize the components that matter.
  * Avoid memoizing entire large trees unless truly necessary.

* **React Compiler**

  * A Babel plugin that auto-memoizes components at build time.
  * Detects components that never change and memoizes them automatically.
  * Removes memoization if code later changes to allow updates.
  * Still unstable; can cause issues, so use cautiously.

* **Debugging Performance**

  * React DevTools Profiler shows re-renders, flame graphs, and memoized components.
  * Future tools (e.g., React Scan) aim to help identify unnecessary re-renders.

* **Bottom Line**

  * Don‚Äôt memoize everything.
  * Use `memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` only where re-renders are expensive.
  * Trust React‚Äôs defaults first; optimize only when performance issues arise.

## Transitions and Perceived Performance

* **Goal of Transitions**

  * Not about making React faster, but about making the UI *feel* faster.
  * Keeps UI responsive while heavy tasks (like page loads) happen in the background.
  * Prevents user frustration when clicking the wrong button or triggering slow actions.

* **Problem Example**

  * Accidentally opening the wrong app on a smart TV remote (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) and waiting 15 seconds for it to load before exiting.
  * Similar issue on websites (e.g., clicking the wrong banking option).

* **Solution: `useTransition` Hook**

  * Allows React to handle heavy updates in the background.
  * Keeps UI interactive so users can cancel, change their mind, or do other actions while loading happens.

* **Demo Setup**

  * Example project: a scoreboard app with slow API responses (artificial 5s delay).
  * Server simulates games with incrementing scores over time.
  * Client built with Vite, connects via proxy to server API.
  * API endpoint: `/score?game=1‚Äì7` ‚Üí returns scores for teams like *Memory Leaks* vs *Garbage Collectors*.

* **Key Idea**

  * Transitions improve *perceived performance* by preventing UI lockups during slow state updates.

## üö´ The "Wrong Way" (Typical React Code Before Transitions)

* **Process flow in the demo app (`App.jsx`)**:

  1. User selects a game.
  2. `getNewScore(game)` is called.
  3. UI immediately sets `isPending = true` (loading).
  4. API call runs (artificial 5s delay).
  5. After response:

     * `setScore(newScore)`
     * `isPending = false`
  6. While waiting ‚Üí **UI locked** (dropdown disabled, loading spinner shown).

* **Problem**:

  * If user selects the wrong game by mistake, they‚Äôre stuck until the fetch finishes.
  * Example: Click **Game 5** but really meant **Game 6** ‚Üí must wait 5s for Game 5 before selecting Game 6.
  * This creates a frustrating UX (like the ‚ÄúNetflix button on a remote‚Äù analogy).

---

### üõë Why this feels bad

* The UI and the data are tightly coupled ‚Üí you can‚Äôt interact until the fetch resolves.
* Any slow backend or API delay = locked UI.
* Classic race-condition risk: if Game 5 fetch returns after Game 6 fetch, the wrong data might overwrite. (Here it‚Äôs avoided by disabling input, but that‚Äôs not user-friendly either.)

---

### ‚úÖ How Transitions Fix This (what comes next)

* `useTransition` decouples **UI updates** (user interactions like selecting a game) from **expensive state updates** (API fetch).
* With transitions:

  * UI remains responsive (user can change selection multiple times quickly).
  * React only applies the *latest* transition ‚Üí stale requests don‚Äôt override newer ones.
  * User doesn‚Äôt feel "stuck" while waiting.

  ## Using `useTransition` in React

* **Why transitions matter**:
  Normal state updates can lock the UI during slow operations (e.g., fetching data).
  `useTransition` lets React mark these updates as *low priority* so the UI stays responsive.

---

### üîë How It Works

1. Import `useTransition`:

   ```js
   const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
   ```
2. Wrap expensive updates:

   ```js
   startTransition(async () => {
     const newScore = await getScore(game);
     setScore(newScore);
   });
   ```
3. UI remains interactive while React processes the background update.

   * No need for `setIsPending` manually.
   * Remove `disabled` props so users can keep interacting.

---

### üöÄ Benefits

* User can switch games rapidly ‚Üí React ensures the *final* choice wins.
* Old requests still run, but their results are ignored if outdated.
* Code stays almost as simple as before, just wrapped in `startTransition`.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Race Conditions

* Rare in small apps, but React docs show *nested transitions* for extra safety:

  ```js
  startTransition(() => {
    startTransition(async () => {
      const newScore = await getScore(game);
      setScore(newScore);
    });
  });
  ```
* This prevents issues during heavy re-renders.

---

### ‚ùì Aborting Requests

* Requests still *complete*, but React ignores their results.
* Could add:

  * **AbortController** to cancel fetches.
  * **Debouncing** to limit rapid-fire requests.
* Often unnecessary unless requests are long-running or expensive.

---

### ‚úÖ Takeaway

* `useTransition` is a ‚Äúchill‚Äù API that improves **perceived performance**.
* Keeps the UI responsive while background work finishes.
* Best practice: use it for slow state updates that don‚Äôt need to block interaction.

## Optimistic UI Updates in React

* **Concept**:

  * When users take an action (e.g., sending a message), the UI immediately reflects the change *before* the server confirms it.
  * Example: In chat apps (WhatsApp, iMessage, etc.), when you send *‚Äúhello‚Äù*, the bubble appears instantly even though the message hasn‚Äôt reached the server yet.

---

### üü¢ Why Optimistic UI?

* Matches the **user‚Äôs mental model**:

  * They typed ‚Üí pressed send ‚Üí they expect to see it instantly.
* Prevents dissonance between user action and system feedback.
* Improves perceived speed and responsiveness.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Without Optimistic UI

* User types ‚Äúhello‚Äù ‚Üí UI shows nothing until server confirms ‚Üí then bubble appears.
* Feels laggy and confusing, since the user believes the action is already done.

---

### ‚ö° With Optimistic UI

1. User types and hits send.
2. Message appears immediately in UI (optimistic state).
3. In background, request is sent to server.
4. If success ‚Üí mark as delivered.
5. If failure ‚Üí show error or retry (e.g., gray bubble, resend icon).

---

### üîß React `useOptimistic` Hook

* Handles optimistic state updates easily.
* Works with React‚Äôs scheduler so you don‚Äôt need custom state hacks.
* Lets you:

  * Show immediate feedback.
  * Update once confirmation arrives.
  * Roll back or adjust if the request fails.

---

### ‚úÖ Takeaway

Optimistic UI updates **favor user experience** over strict confirmation.
They make apps feel faster, natural, and responsive‚Äîessential for chat apps, forms, and any action where users expect instant feedback.

### The **‚Äúold way‚Äù**:

* User submits a thought.
* The client **waits** for the server to respond.
* Only *after* a response comes back (5s delay + 20% chance of error), the UI updates.
* This feels **laggy** and unnatural because the user doesn‚Äôt see their thought appear right away.

He also showed the little bug (`setThought` instead of `setThoughts`) which caused nothing to render. Fixed now.

---

### üî¥ Current UX Problem

* Type a thought ‚Üí hit submit ‚Üí nothing happens for \~5s.
* If server errors ‚Üí alert shows up, nothing appears.
* If server succeeds ‚Üí the new thought appears.
* That waiting gap = frustrating.

---

### üü¢ Optimistic UI Plan

Instead of waiting for the server:

1. Immediately show the thought in the UI (optimistic state).
2. Send request in background.
3. If it succeeds ‚Üí do nothing (state already matches).
4. If it fails ‚Üí remove the thought and show an error (or mark it failed).

This matches how messaging apps work (WhatsApp, iMessage, etc.).

---

### ‚ö° How React Helps (`useOptimistic`)

* Without React‚Äôs `useOptimistic`, you‚Äôd manually `setThoughts([...thoughts, newThought])`, then remove it on failure.
* With `useOptimistic`, you can declare:

  * ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how state *would look* if this action succeeds.‚Äù
  * React applies it immediately.
  * Once real data arrives (or fails), it reconciles automatically.

So the hook saves you from juggling temporary state + rollback manually.

### Refactor into `useOptimistic` + `useTransition`**

## üî¥ Before (non-optimistic flow)

* User types ‚Üí hits submit.
* Nothing shows in UI until API resolves.
* 5s feels like forever ‚Üí poor UX.
* If error ‚Üí nothing is added.

---

## üü¢ After (optimistic flow with `useOptimistic`)

1. Import hooks:

```js
import { useTransition, useOptimistic } from "react";
```

2. Set up transition + optimistic state:

```js
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

const [optimisticThoughts, addOptimisticThought] = useOptimistic(
  thoughts,
  (oldThoughts, newThought) => [newThought, ...oldThoughts] // prepend
);
```

* `optimisticThoughts` ‚Üí the array you actually render.
* `addOptimisticThought(newThought)` ‚Üí immediately injects it.
* Once server returns, React reconciles, so your ‚Äúloading‚Äù placeholder disappears.

---

3. Inside submit handler:

```js
async function postDeepThought(thought) {
  // immediately show in UI with "loading" marker
  addOptimisticThought({ thought, loading: true });

  startTransition(async () => {
    try {
      const res = await fetch("/api/thoughts", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({ thought }),
      });
      const data = await res.json();

      // actual server update ‚Üí reconciles with real thoughts
      setThoughts(data.thoughts);
    } catch (err) {
      // handle error (design choice: red ‚ùóÔ∏è, retry button, etc.)
      console.error(err);
    }
  });
}
```

---

4. Render from `optimisticThoughts`:

```jsx
<ul>
  {optimisticThoughts.map((t, i) => (
    <li key={i}>
      {t.thought} {t.loading && <span>‚è≥</span>}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

---

## üí° Error handling

Brian‚Äôs point:

* `alert("fail")` = bad UX ‚ùå.
* Better: keep the bubble in place with a **red exclamation ‚ùóÔ∏è** or ‚ÄúRetry‚Äù button.
* That way the user knows: *‚ÄúIt looked like it sent, but it failed. Want to resend?‚Äù*
* This is **UI/UX design**, not a React limitation.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

* Snappy ‚Üí users *see* their action right away.
* Correct ‚Üí React reconciles when server confirms.
* Graceful failures ‚Üí you can design around errors without confusing users.

## Deferred Values with `useDeferredValue`

* **Problem**: Some updates (like sliders or image editing) trigger *extremely frequent re-renders*.

  * Example: dragging a slider may fire updates multiple times per millisecond.
  * If expensive computations run on each update ‚Üí **jank** (laggy UI).

* **Solution**: `useDeferredValue`

  * Lets React delay re-renders of expensive values until input activity settles.
  * Keeps UI *responsive* while heavy computation catches up.

* **How it works**:

  * Wrap a frequently changing value with `useDeferredValue(value)`.
  * React‚Äôs scheduler decides:

    * On **fast devices** ‚Üí still renders many frames (smooth).
    * On **slow devices** ‚Üí skips intermediate frames (avoids jank).

* **Use cases**:

  * Sliders in image/video editors (blur, brightness, etc.).
  * Large list filtering or sorting while typing.
  * Any CPU-heavy calculations during rapid user input.

* **Benefit over debounce/throttle**:

  * Debounce/throttle applies the *same delay to everyone*.
  * `useDeferredValue` adapts automatically:

    * Slow devices = throttled.
    * Fast devices = responsive.

* **Analogy**: Like low-power mode on phones throttling CPU ‚Üí fewer renders.

  * React leverages the scheduler to optimize automatically.

## Building an Image Editor with Sliders

* **Setup**:

  * Added `slider.jsx` ‚Üí reusable slider component.
  * Added `displayImage.jsx` ‚Üí renders image with filters, simulates heavy rendering with delay.
  * Uses dog image (`Luna.jpg`), but can be replaced with any image.

* **Slider Component** (`Slider`):

  * Props: `value`, `deferredValue`, `onChange`, `name`, `max`.
  * Displays label, slider (`input type="range"`), and output values.
  * Shows `"updating"` when `value !== deferredValue`.

* **DisplayImage Component**:

  * Accepts `filterStyle` (CSS filters as string).
  * Simulates heavy rendering with artificial delay.
  * Renders image with applied filters + shows last render time.

* **App Component**:

  * State hooks for image filters: `blur`, `brightness`, `contrast`, `saturate`, `sepia`.
  * Each has initial values and slider ranges:

    * Blur: `0‚Äì20px`
    * Brightness: `0‚Äì200%` (default `100`)
    * Contrast: `0‚Äì200%` (default `100`)
    * Saturate: `0‚Äì200%` (default `100`)
    * Sepia: `0‚Äì100%`
  * Builds combined `filterStyle` string ‚Üí passed to `DisplayImage`.
  * Renders `<ul>` of sliders, each tied to its filter.

* **Key Idea**:

  * Without `useDeferredValue`, frequent slider changes cause noticeable jank.
  * Next step: integrate `useDeferredValue` to smooth performance.

## Using `useDeferredValue` to Reduce Jank

* **Problem**:

  * Sliders feel laggy because `DisplayImage` simulates an expensive render.
  * Without optimization, every slider move re-renders image immediately ‚Üí jank.

* **Traditional Fix**:

  * Developers used to rely on **throttle** or **debounce** to delay updates.
  * Harder to manage and required manual logic.

* **React Fix (`useDeferredValue`)**:

  * Marks certain renders as **low priority**.
  * Example:

    ```js
    const deferredBlur = useDeferredValue(blur);
    const deferredBrightness = useDeferredValue(brightness);
    const deferredContrast = useDeferredValue(contrast);
    const deferredSaturate = useDeferredValue(saturate);
    const deferredSepia = useDeferredValue(sepia);
    ```
  * Sliders update instantly, but `DisplayImage` updates more slowly.
  * React adapts automatically depending on device performance.

* **Remaining Issue**:

  * Even with `useDeferredValue`, parent re-renders still caused image updates.

* **Solution**: `memo`

  * Memoize `DisplayImage` so it only re-renders when deferred values actually change.
  * Prevents wasteful re-renders on every slider movement.

* **Result**:

  * Smoother sliders with reduced jank.
  * Image updates less frequently, but UI feels more responsive.
  * React handles frequency automatically (fast devices update more often, slow ones less).

* **Key Insight**:

  * Use `useDeferredValue` for expensive recalculations triggered by rapidly changing inputs.
  * Combine with `memo` to ensure components only re-render when values truly change.

## Q\&A Highlights with Brian Holt

* **Using RSCs vs Alternatives**

  * If your app is very **client-heavy**, RSCs may not add much.
  * Alternatives: **Remix/React Router 7** or **TanStack Start**.
  * TanStack Start emphasizes a **client-first approach with light server usage**, while Next.js is more **server-first**.
  * Both Remix and TanStack Start are valid; choice depends on preference.

* **Self-hosting Next.js**

  * Yes, it‚Äôs possible.
  * Run it like a **Node service**.
  * Works best on **Vercel**, but many self-host successfully.

* **Testing `useDeferredValue` / `useTransition`**

  * Don‚Äôt test React internals.
  * Focus on **user experience**: does the UI show immediate feedback and reconcile later to the correct state?
  * Test behavior, not framework implementation.

* **Building a Career in React**

  * Hiring managers care more about **depth and passion projects** than which framework (Next vs Remix).
  * Ship projects fully‚Äîfinishing is more impressive than multiple unfinished ones.
  * A great Remix app > a poor Next app.
  * Follow what excites you, go deep, and **deploy real apps**.

* **Full-text Search on Static Sites**

  * Options: Elasticsearch, Solr, Pinecone, etc.
  * Brian‚Äôs preference: **Postgres** with extensions like **PGVector** or **PG RAG**.
  * Postgres handles most needs well.

* **Managing RSC vs Client Components in Large Projects**

  * Rarely need to switch components between server and client.
  * Pattern: push **client state down the tree** to minimize client components.
  * Don‚Äôt over-optimize for switching‚Äîgenerally a clear divide exists:

    * RSCs ‚Üí fetching from DB.
    * Client components ‚Üí handling user input.

## Intermediate React v6 Wrap-Up

* You now have the skills to tackle nearly any **React problem**.
* Most remaining React APIs (e.g., `useLayoutEffect`, CSS insertion hooks) are mainly for **library authors**, not app developers.
* Next steps / project ideas:

  * Add **authentication** to apps.
  * Take your **Next.js app** and deploy it (Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify, GCP App Engine, Firebase, etc.).
  * Move your **database to the cloud** (e.g., Neon, or any cloud DB).
  * Extend your notes app:

    * Add **Twitter-like feed** to see other users‚Äô posts.
    * Add a **wall** for posting.
    * Create an **admin feature**.
  * Experiment with **AI integration** (AWS Bedrock, Together AI, GitHub models) for fun apps like an **AI social network**.
* Best advice: **build and ship projects**‚Äîpractice will reinforce learning.
* Brian encourages sharing projects with him via Twitter or Blue Sky.

## Core Parts of Every API

APIs, regardless of language or framework, share common building blocks:

### 1. **Server**

* A server is an application that runs continuously without a visual interface.
* It listens for requests from clients (web apps, mobile apps, other services) and responds.
* Typically sits in front of a database and acts as the gatekeeper (like a bouncer at a club).
* Servers must run on a **port** (a unique number identifying a service on a machine).
* Each server also has an **IP address** (like a home address), which ensures uniqueness across a network.

Example:

```
http://127.0.0.1:3001
```

* `127.0.0.1` ‚Üí IP address (localhost)
* `3001` ‚Üí port

### 2. **Routes**

* A route = **HTTP method + URL path**.
* Defines what action to take when a request is received.
* Example routes:

  * `GET /api/user/1` ‚Üí retrieve user info
  * `POST /api/food` ‚Üí create a new food record

### 3. **HTTP Methods**

* **GET** ‚Üí retrieve data
* **POST** ‚Üí create new data
* **PUT** ‚Üí replace existing data
* **PATCH** ‚Üí update part of existing data
* **DELETE** ‚Üí remove data
* **OPTIONS** ‚Üí used internally for CORS checks

### 4. **Route Handlers**

* Functions that run when a request matches a route.
* Comparable to event handlers in the frontend (e.g., `onclick`).
* This is where the server interacts with databases, performs logic, and returns a response.

### 5. **Design Patterns**

* While developers can technically do anything with methods/routes, agreed patterns bring consistency.
* The most common is **REST** (Representational State Transfer).
* Alternatives include **GraphQL**, **gRPC**, and **Protobuf**.

## Express.js Basics

* **What is Express?**

  * The most popular Node.js framework for building APIs.
  * Built on top of the now-defunct Connect library.
  * Similar to Django (Python), Sinatra (Ruby), Spring (Java), Gin (Go).
  * Lightweight, respected, widely adopted, and not going away.

* **Installing & Setting Up Express**

  ```bash
  npm i express --save
  ```

  * Create `server.js`.
  * Import and initialize Express:

    ```js
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();
    ```
  * Define a route:

    ```js
    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.status(200).json({ message: "hello" });
    });
    ```
  * Export app:

    ```js
    module.exports = app;
    ```
  * In `index.js`:

    ```js
    const app = require("./server");
    app.listen(3001, () => console.log("Server running on port 3001"));
    ```

* **Status Codes**

  * `200‚Äì299` ‚Üí success
  * `400‚Äì499` ‚Üí client errors (e.g., bad input)
  * `500‚Äì599` ‚Üí server errors (e.g., crash, DB issues)
  * Respecting status codes helps browsers, tools, and clients interpret responses correctly.

* **Responses with Express**

  * Can send back JSON, text, HTML, images, or any file/data type.
  * Example:

    ```js
    res.send("Hello World");     // plain text
    res.json({ msg: "Hello" }); // JSON
    res.sendFile("/path/to/file.html"); // file
    ```

* **Why Express Helps**

  * Replaces messy `if` statements for routing with clean, declarative methods.
  * Handles HTTP methods and paths without manually writing logic.
  * Provides helpful utilities on `req` and `res` objects.
